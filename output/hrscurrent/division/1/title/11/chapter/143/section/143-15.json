[L 1941, c 268, \u00a714; RL 1945, \u00a77165; RL 1955, \u00a7156-15; HRS \u00a7143-15]\n\u00a0\nAttorney General Opinions\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 The plain language and legislative history of this section and \u00a7143-16 made very clear that legislature intended to authorize county reliance upon private humane societies to impound stray dogs within their borders; this can be accomplished only if \u00a7\u00a776-16(17) and 76-77(10) are interpreted broadly.\u00a0 Att. Gen. Op. 97-6."
