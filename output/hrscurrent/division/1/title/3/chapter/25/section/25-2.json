and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (6)\u00a0 Where practicable, submergence of an area in a larger district wherein substantially different socio-economic interests predominate shall be avoided.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Not more than one hundred days from the date on which all members are certified, the commission shall cause public notice to be given of a congressional reapportionment plan prepared and proposed by the commission.\u00a0 The commission shall conduct public hearings on the proposed plan in the manner prescribed under subsection (a).\u00a0 At least one public hearing shall be held in each basic island unit after initial public notice of the plan.\u00a0 After the last of the public hearings, but in no event later than one hundred fifty days from the date on which all members of the commission are certified, the commission shall determine whether or not the plan is in need of correction or modification, make the correction or modification, if any, and file with the chief election officer, a final congressional reapportionment plan.\u00a0 Within fourteen days after filing of the final reapportionment plan, the chief election officer shall cause public notice to be given of the final congressional reapportionment plan which, upon public notice, shall become effective as of the date of filing and govern the election of members of the United States House of Representatives allocated to this State for the next five succeeding congresses.

Rev. 269.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Plaintiff citizens had not shown a likelihood of succeeding on their claim that Hawaii's legislative reapportionment plan's use of a permanent resident base, coupled with extraction of military personnel, their dependents, and students, constituted an equal protection violation for the purpose of a preliminary injunction; further, the equities and public interest tipped overwhelmingly in defendant reapportionment commission's favor, as any preliminary relief at this stage would significantly upend the election process; plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction denied.\u00a0 878 F. Supp. 2d 1124 (2012).\n\u00a0 Hawaii's choice of a permanent resident population base for the 2012 reapportionment plan was constitutionally permissible; among other things, there was no evidence that Hawaii discriminated unreasonably among non-resident groups.\u00a0 960 F. Supp. 2d 1074 (2013).\n\u00a0 Plaintiffs had standing to assert equal protection challenges to Hawaii's 2012 reapportionment plan, where plaintiffs had suffered the injury of losing an Oahu senate seat and three of the plaintiffs lived in underrepresented districts.\u00a0 960 F. Supp. 2d 1074 (2013).\n\u00a0 Where plaintiffs contended that the reapportionment commission violated the equal protection clause by apportioning Hawaii's legislative districts unequally, the reapportionment commission's justifications for the challenged population deviations embodied rational, legitimate, and substantial state policies, and the 2012 reapportionment plan reasonably advanced those policies in a neutral and nondiscriminatory manner.\u00a0 960 F. Supp. 2d 1074 (2013)."
