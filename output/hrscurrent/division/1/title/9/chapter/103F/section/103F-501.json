[L 1997, c 190, pt of \u00a72]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 As nothing in this chapter expressly precluded judicial review, it did not violate the separation of powers doctrine; judicial review was available in connection with chapter 103F by way of a declaratory action under \u00a7632-1.\u00a0 127 H. 76, 276 P.3d 645 (2012).\n\u00a0 Although \u00a7632-1 generally endorses declaratory relief in civil cases, it disallows such relief where a statute provides a special form of remedy for a specific type of case; where this chapter provided for a protest process under this section through \u00a7103F-504, and \u00a7103F-504 limited the protestor to an administrative process as the \"exclusive means\" to resolve contract disputes, declaratory relief under \u00a7632-1 was unavailable because \u00a7632-1 specifically mandates that the statutory remedy provided in this chapter must be followed.\u00a0 125 H. 200 (App.), 257 P.3d 213.\n\u00a0 Under the express terms of \u00a7103D-709(c), petitioner could not seek review of the chief procurement officer\u0092s decision on a chapter 103F health and human services contract pursuant to chapter 103D unless the protest was decided under one of the sections listed in \u00a7103D-709(c); \u00a7103D-709(c) thus foreclosed petitioner from seeking review of the chief procurement officer\u0092s decision made pursuant to this section under the procedures of \u00a7103D-709.\u00a0 127 H. 76, 276 P.3d 645 (2012).\n\u00a0 Under the circumstances of the case, the decisions of the administrative officers of the department of education to reject the proposal of petitioner that responded to a request for proposals to provide health and human services under contracts pursuant to this chapter were subject to judicial review; \u00a7\u00a7103F-502(c) and 103F-504 and this section do not prohibit judicial review.\u00a0 127 H. 263, 277 P.3d 988 (2012)."
