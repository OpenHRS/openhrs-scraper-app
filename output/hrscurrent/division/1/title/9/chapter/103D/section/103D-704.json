[L Sp 1993, c 8, pt of \u00a72; am L 1997, c 352, \u00a723]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Procurement code was not relevant to employer's claim for breach of duty of loyalty.\u00a0 338 F.3d 1082.\n\u00a0 A protester is entitled to recover attorney's fees incurred in prosecuting its protest if the protester has proven the solicitation was in violation of this code, the contract was awarded in violation of \u00a7103D-701(f), and award of contract was in bad faith.\u00a0 85 H. 431, 946 P.2d 1.\n\u00a0 This section, the \"exclusive remedy\" provision of chapter 103D, the public procurement code, barred plaintiff, a sub-consultant, from bringing a lawsuit against the defendant city seeking damages sounding in tort for injury suffered as a result of the city's alleged violations of the code; plaintiff was on notice under the code that it could not, in its own right, bring a direct challenge to the procurement process in the event it disputed the actions of the procurement agency; the legislative scheme encompassed the notion that challenges would be brought by the primary parties in the process--the contractor or prospective bidder or offeror. 121 H. 527 (App.), 221 P.3d 505."
