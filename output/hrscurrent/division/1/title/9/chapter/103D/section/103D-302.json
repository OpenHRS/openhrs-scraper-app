and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (3)\u00a0 How notice may be published, including publication in a newspaper of general circulation, notice by mail to all persons on any applicable bidders mailing list, publication by any public or private telecommunication information network, or any other method of publication it deems to be effective.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (d)\u00a0 Bids shall be opened publicly in the presence of one or more witnesses, at the time and place designated in the invitation for bids.\u00a0 The amount of each bid and other relevant information specified by rule, together with the name of each bidder shall be recorded.\u00a0 The record and each bid shall be open to public inspection.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (e)\u00a0 Bids shall be unconditionally accepted without alteration or correction, except as authorized in this chapter or by rules adopted by the policy board.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (f)\u00a0 Bids shall be evaluated based on the requirements set forth in the invitation for bids.\u00a0 These requirements may include criteria to determine acceptability such as inspection, testing, quality, workmanship, delivery, and suitability for a particular purpose.\u00a0 Those criteria that will affect the bid price and be considered in evaluation for award shall be objectively measurable, such as discounts, transportation costs, and total or life cycle costs.\u00a0 The invitation for bids shall set forth the evaluation criteria to be used.\u00a0 No criteria may be used in bid evaluation that are not set forth in the invitation for bids.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (g)\u00a0 Correction or withdrawal of inadvertently erroneous bids before or after award, or cancellation of invitations for bids, awards, or contracts based on such bid mistakes, shall be permitted in accordance with rules adopted by the policy board.\u00a0 After bid opening no changes in bid prices or other provisions of bids prejudicial to the interest of the public or to fair competition shall be permitted.\u00a0 Except as otherwise provided by rule, all decisions to permit the correction or withdrawal of bids, or to cancel awards or contracts based on bid mistakes, shall be supported by a written determination made by the chief procurement officer or head of a purchasing agency.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (h)\u00a0 The contract shall be awarded with reasonable promptness by written notice to the lowest responsible and responsive bidder whose bid meets the requirements and criteria set forth in the invitation for bids.\u00a0 In the event all bids exceed available funds as certified by the appropriate fiscal officer, the head of the purchasing agency responsible for the procurement in question is authorized in situations where time or economic considerations preclude resolicitation of work of a reduced scope to negotiate an adjustment of the bid price, including changes in the bid requirements, with the low responsible and responsive bidder, in order to bring the bid within the amount of available funds.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (i)\u00a0 When it is not practicable to initially prepare a purchase description to support an award based on price, an invitation for bids, which requests the submission of unpriced offers to be followed by an invitation for bids limited to those bidders whose offers have been qualified under the criteria set forth in the first solicitation, may be used.\u00a0 If a multi-step sealed bidding process is used, the notice and the invitation for bids shall describe each step to be used in soliciting, evaluating, and selecting unpriced offers.
