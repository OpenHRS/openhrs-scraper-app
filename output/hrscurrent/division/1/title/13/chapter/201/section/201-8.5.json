provided that the impact of artificial light on shoreline and ocean waters shall be subject to compliance with section 205A\u201171.\u00a0 A lighting fixture is considered to be fully shielded when the lighting fixture is shielded in such a manner that all light rays emitted by the fixture, either directly from the lamp, or indirectly from the fixture, are projected below a horizontal plane running through the lowest point of the fixture.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b)\u00a0 No new mercury vapor lamps shall be sold or installed after July 1, 2014.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (c)\u00a0 As applicable, retrofit work or replacement of existing lighting fixtures shall:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 Limit the rated correlated color temperature of emitted light (lamp, fixture, and filter if used) to less than or equal to four thousand Kelvin, except in the case of outdoor athletic facilities as described in subsection (d);\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 Not be subject to the shielding requirement for lamp-by-lamp replacement work;

and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 Installed and maintained with minimum aiming angles of twenty-five degrees downward from the horizontal; provided that the aiming angle shall be measured from the axis of the luminaire maximum beam candlepower, as certified by an independent testing agency.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (e)\u00a0 Fully shielded replacement lighting fixtures for state managed roadways and highways shall be installed on a case-by-case basis, subject to the availability of capital improvement project funding and compliance with applicable federal, state, or county design standards or guidelines.\u00a0 Where fully shielded fixtures are not used, acceptable luminaires shall be partially shielded lights that emit no more than five per cent of their light above the horizontal plane, as certified by an independent testing agency.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (f)\u00a0 The use of existing nonconforming lighting fixtures shall be allowed, subject to compliance with subsection (c)(3), for:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 Lighting fixtures that are extinguished between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and sunrise by an automatic shutoff device;
