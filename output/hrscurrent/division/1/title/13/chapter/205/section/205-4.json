and (B) the admission of additional parties will render the proceedings inefficient and unmanageable.\u00a0 A person whose application to intervene is denied may appeal such denial to the circuit court pursuant to section 91-14.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (5)\u00a0 The commission shall pursuant to chapter 91 adopt rules governing the intervention of agencies and persons under this subsection.\u00a0 Such rules shall without limitation establish:\u00a0 (A) the information to be set forth in any application for intervention; (B) time limits within which such applications shall be filed; and (C) reasonable filing fees to accompany such applications.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (f)\u00a0 Together with other witnesses that the commission may desire to hear at the hearing, it shall allow a representative of a citizen or a community group to testify who indicates a desire to express the view of such citizen or community group concerning the proposed boundary change.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (g)\u00a0 Within a period of not more than three hundred sixty-five days after the proper filing of a petition, unless otherwise ordered by a court, or unless a time extension, which shall not exceed ninety days, is established by a two-thirds vote of the members of the commission, the commission, by filing findings of fact and conclusions of law, shall act to approve the petition, deny the petition, or to modify the petition by imposing conditions necessary to uphold the intent and spirit of this chapter or the policies and criteria established pursuant to section 205-17 or to assure substantial compliance with representations made by the petitioner in seeking a boundary change.\u00a0 The commission may provide by condition that absent substantial commencement of use of the land in accordance with such representations, the commission shall issue and serve upon the party bound by the condition an order to show cause why the property should not revert to its former land use classification or be changed to a more appropriate classification.\u00a0 Such conditions, if any, shall run with the land and be recorded in the bureau of conveyances.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (h)\u00a0 No amendment of a land use district boundary shall be approved unless the commission finds upon the clear preponderance of the evidence that the proposed boundary is reasonable, not violative of section 205-2 and part III of this chapter, and consistent with the policies and criteria established pursuant to sections 205-16 and 205-17.\u00a0 Six affirmative votes of the commission shall be necessary for any boundary amendment under this section.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (i)\u00a0 Parties to proceedings to amend land use district boundaries may obtain judicial review thereof in the manner set forth in section 91-14, provided that the court may also reverse or modify a finding of the commission if such finding appears to be contrary to the clear preponderance of the evidence.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (j)\u00a0 At the hearing, all parties may enter into appropriate stipulations as to findings of fact, conclusions of law, and conditions of reclassification concerning the proposed boundary change.\u00a0 The commission may but shall not be required to approve such stipulations based on the evidence adduced.
