[L 1975, c 176, pt of \u00a71; am L 1979, c 200, \u00a713; am L 2001, c 169, \u00a77]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Where the appellant failed to file an appeal with the Maui planning commission regarding the county director of planning's issuance of a special management area minor permit, the doctrine of primary jurisdiction warranted dismissal of the case; the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in choosing to refrain from exercising jurisdiction.\u00a0 132 H. 472 (App.), 323 P.3d 116 (2012).\n\u00a0 Where the defendants contended that the case was moot because it pertained to the issuance of a special management area minor permit for an event that occurred prior to appeal, the appeal retained vitality because the questions presented were of public concern and, in the likely event that they recurred in the future, were of a nature that would likely become moot before they could be determined on appeal.\u00a0 132 H. 472 (App.), 323 P.3d 116 (2012)."
