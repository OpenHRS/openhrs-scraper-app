App. 377, 842 P.2d 648.\n\u00a0 Even if the development was shown to have a substantial adverse effect in accordance with the statute, planning commission was required under paragraph (2)(A) to determine whether that effect could be practicably minimized and, when minimized, whether the effect was clearly outweighed by public health, safety, or compelling public interests.\u00a0 9 H. App. 377, 842 P.2d 648.\n\u00a0 Paragraph (3)(D) mandated planning commission to protect and preserve more than just the view of the shoreline; the statute, by its very language, is intended to protect the view toward the sea even though the \"shoreline\" cannot be seen either because of intervening development or natural growth.\u00a0 9 H.
