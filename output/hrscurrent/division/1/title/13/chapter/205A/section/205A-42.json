[L 1986, c 258, pt of \u00a71; gen ch 1993; am L 1995, c 102, \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 The board of land and natural resources must consider historical evidence in making its shoreline determination.\u00a0 132 H. 9, 319 P.3d 1017 (2014).\n\u00a0 The board of land and natural resources' ultimate shoreline determination was invalid because the agency made errors of law in its amended decision, including, among other things, positing a multi-variable approach to shoreline certifications and disregarding a person's testimony. 132 H. 9, 319 P.3d 1017 (2014).\n\u00a0 The contention that \"the ultimate determination of the upper reaches of the wash of the waves at high tide ... is [solely] one for experts and those qualified under the law\" is wrong as a matter of law.\u00a0 132 H. 9, 319 P.3d 1017 (2014).\n\u00a0 The issuance of an amended decision by the board of land and natural resources rendered moot any appeal from the original administrative agency decision because the original administrative agency decision was no longer effective. \u00a0132 H. 9, 319 P.3d 1017 (2014)."
