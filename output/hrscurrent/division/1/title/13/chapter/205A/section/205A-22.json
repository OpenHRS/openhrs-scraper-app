Gen. Op. 75-18.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Where no express procedure provided in Maui charter or Maui special management area rules for appeal of Maui planning director's decision on a minor permit application to the Maui planning commission, and commission delegated authority to render final decision on minor permit applications to director pursuant to this section, director's decision not to process developer's application was a final decision equivalent to a denial of the application and was thus appealable under \u00a791-14(a).\u00a0 88 H. 108, 962 P.2d 367.\n\u00a0 Where defendant's tour boat operation changed the intensity of use of water in the Hanalei special management area, defendant's tour boat operation constituted a \"development\", within the meaning of this section, that was not exempt from the coastal zone management act or special management area rules.\u00a0 89 H. 400, 974 P.2d 40.\n\u00a0 Special management area minor permit issued by county to public utility invalid and public utility required to obtain special management area use permit for its cellular telephone tower where county board of appeals finding that valuation of tower development did not exceed $125,000 was clearly erroneous.\u00a0 90 H. 384, 978 P.2d 822.\n\u00a0 Where land lease did not constitute a \"development\" under this chapter, trial court erred in ruling that valuation of cellular telephone tower development must include value of the land lease; instead, valuation consisted of the \"current replacement cost\" of the structures built.\u00a0 90 H. 384, 978 P.2d 822.\n\u00a0 Where developer's proposed subdivision fell within the definition of \"development\" found in this section, trial court correctly determined that a special management area use permit was required.\u00a0 109 H. 384, 126 P.3d 1071 (2006).\n\u00a0 \"Development\" includes that which is planned.\u00a0 4 H. App. 304, 666 P.2d 177.\n\u00a0 Where the appellant failed to file an appeal with the Maui planning commission regarding the county director of planning's issuance of a special management area minor permit, the doctrine of primary jurisdiction warranted dismissal of the case; the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in choosing to refrain from exercising jurisdiction.\u00a0 132 H. 472 (App.), 323 P.3d 116 (2012).\n\u00a0 Where the defendants contended that the case was moot because it pertained to the issuance of a special management area minor permit for an event that occurred prior to appeal, the appeal retained vitality because the questions presented were of public concern and, in the likely event that they recurred in the future, were of a nature that would likely become moot before they could be determined on appeal.\u00a0 132 H. 472 (App.), 323 P.3d 116 (2012)."
