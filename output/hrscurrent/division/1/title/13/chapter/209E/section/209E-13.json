[L 1986, c 78, pt of \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nAttorney General Opinions\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Qualified businesses located in new enterprise zone (EZ) would be eligible for state tax incentives for seven-year period set forth in \u00a7\u00a7209E-10(a) and 209E-11, although a portion of that seven-year period extended beyond new EZ's five-year sunset date.\u00a0 Att. Gen. Op. 98-1.\n\u00a0 Where new enterprise zone (EZ) was created legislatively by Act 262, L 1997, the Act did not require city and county to offer county-level incentives to qualified businesses in the new EZ.\u00a0 Att. Gen. Op. 98-1."
