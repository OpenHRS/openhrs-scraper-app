[L 1972, c 163, pt of \u00a71; gen ch 1985; am L 2012, c 208, \u00a74]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Although an application of this section was necessary to decide the union's complaint under \u00a789-13, it could not be said that the question arose under chapter 84; where union filed the complaint with the labor relations board under \u00a789-19, the board had \"exclusive original jurisdiction\" to determine prohibited practice complaints and the ethics commission would not have had jurisdiction to make that determination; thus, the board had the power to apply this section in order to decide whether a prohibited practice violation actually occurred and it did not exceed its jurisdiction in ruling that a violation did not occur based on the application of this section.\u00a0 116 H. 73, 170 P.3d 324.\n\u00a0 As this section prohibited the posting of campaign materials on a union bulletin board on the fourth floor of a state building, and nothing in chapter 89 was explicitly contrary to, or inconsistent with, that construction, there was no conflict between \u00a789-3 and this section.\u00a0 116 H. 73, 170 P.3d 324. \n\u00a0 Where the posting of campaign materials on a union bulletin board on the fourth floor of a state building was prohibited by this section, and was thus not lawful, the postings were not protected under the express language of \u00a789-3 (2006). 116 H. 73, 170 P.3d 324. \n\u00a0 Where the State, as employer, expressed a \"legitimate\" concern with campaign materials postings on the union bulletin board on the fourth floor of the department of transportation building, inasmuch as the supervisors at the department believed them to be in violation of this section and an ethics commission bulletin entitled \"Campaign Restrictions for State Officials and State Employees\", and there was no Hawaii labor relations board finding of \"union animus\", the removal of campaign materials from the union bulletin board did not infringe on the \"mutual aid or protection\" clause of \u00a789-3 (2006).\u00a0 116 H. 73, 170 P.3d 324."
