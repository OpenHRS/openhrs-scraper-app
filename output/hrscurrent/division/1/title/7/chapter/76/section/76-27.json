Gen. Op. 63-53.\n\u00a0 Section conflicts with 14-32-3, Hawaii Administrative Rules.\u00a0 Att. Gen. Op. 90-8.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 It was undisputed that plaintiff failed the examination process during plaintiff's probationary period with the police department; therefore, plaintiff was never legally entitled to membership in the civil service and plaintiff's employment status with the police department was not protected by the statutes that provide protections to civil service employees.\u00a0 937 F. Supp. 2d 1220 (2013)."
