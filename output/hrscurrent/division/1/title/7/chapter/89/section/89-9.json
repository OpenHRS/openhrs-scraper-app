and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (8)\u00a0 Take such actions as may be necessary to carry out the missions of the employer in cases of emergencies.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This subsection shall not be used to invalidate provisions of collective bargaining agreements in effect on and after June 30, 2007, and shall not preclude negotiations over the procedures and criteria on promotions, transfers, assignments, demotions, layoffs, suspensions, terminations, discharges, or other disciplinary actions as a permissive subject of bargaining during collective bargaining negotiations or negotiations over a memorandum of agreement, memorandum of understanding, or other supplemental agreement.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Violations of the procedures and criteria so negotiated may be subject to the grievance procedure in the collective bargaining agreement.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (e)\u00a0 Negotiations relating to contributions to the Hawaii employer-union health benefits trust fund shall be for the purpose of agreeing upon the amounts which the State and counties shall contribute under section 87A-32, toward the payment of the costs for a health benefits plan, as defined in section 87A-1, and group life insurance benefits, and the parties shall not be bound by the amounts contributed under prior agreements;

Gen. Op. 74-12.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Where dates upon which plaintiffs were paid were not a \"cost item\" as that term is defined in \u00a789-2, plaintiffs' contention that timing of their paychecks as it stood on June 30, 1999 was continued another two years until July 1, 2001 by Act 100, L 1999 (which, inter alia, amended this section), lacked merit.\u00a0 Even if payroll lag was a cost item, the collective bargaining agreement expired on June 30, 1999; plaintiffs' rights under the collective bargaining agreement expired on that day.\u00a0 125 F. Supp. 2d 1237.\n\u00a0 Board was empowered to make declaratory judgment regarding validity of collective bargaining agreement.\u00a0 60 H. 436, 591 P.2d 113.\n\u00a0 Section does not bar arbitration of grievances over tenure and promotion.\u00a0 66 H. 207, 659 P.2d 717.\n\u00a0 Does not limit board's power to order union to implement staffing of essential positions.\u00a0 66 H. 461, 667 P.2d 783.\n\u00a0 Policy statement was not bargainable to the extent that it constituted compliance with the Drug-Free Workplace Act.\u00a0 Because the Act inherently mandated implementation, appellant need not wait until appellee attempted an implementation of an apparatus to effectuate the policy; because implementation would affect bargainable topics, appellant may initiate bargaining at any time upon such topics.\u00a0 79 H. 154, 900 P.2d 161.\n\u00a0 County did not violate collective bargaining statutes by refusing to bargain over effects of privatization where because privatization effort was contrary to law, it was outside scope of negotiable topics.\u00a0 85 H. 61, 937 P.2d 397.\n\u00a0 Section 2 of Act 100, L 1999 violated the rights of public employees under article XIII, \u00a72 of the Hawaii constitution by amending this section to prohibit public employers and public employees' unions from collectively bargaining over cost items for the biennium 1999 to 2001.\u00a0 100 H. 138, 58 P.3d 649.\n\u00a0 Section 2 of Act 100, L 1999 (which amended subsection (a)) violated article XIII, \u00a72 of the Hawaii constitution because it withdrew from the collective bargaining process core subjects such as wages, hours, and other conditions of employment that the voters contemplated would be part of the bargaining process when they ratified article XIII, \u00a72.\u00a0 101 H. 46, 62 P.3d 189.\n\u00a0 The general prohibition in subsection (d) against a public employer and the exclusive representative of a collective bargaining unit agreeing to a \"proposal inconsistent with merit principles\" is subject to this subsection's provisions allowing for, inter alia, negotiation of promotion and demotion procedures in a collective bargaining agreement and a grievance process for violation thereof; \u00a776-1, Revised Charter of Honolulu \u00a7\u00a76-302, 6-306, 6-308, and rules of the civil service commission \u00a7\u00a713-2 and 13-3 do not conflict with subsection (d).\u00a0 106 H. 205, 103 P.3d 365.\n\u00a0 In light of the plain language of subsection (d), labor relations board erred in concluding that the city's proposed transfer of refuse workers from one location to another was subject to collective bargaining under subsection (a).\u00a0 106 H. 359, 105 P.3d 236.\n\u00a0 As subsection (d) precludes collective bargaining over classification issues and thus places them out of the reach of an arbitrator, who derived jurisdiction and authority from the collective bargaining agreement, arbitrator lacked arbitral jurisdiction.\u00a0 101 H. 11 (App.), 61 P.3d 522."
