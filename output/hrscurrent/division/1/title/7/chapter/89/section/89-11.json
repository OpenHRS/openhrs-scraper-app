Rev. 477.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Before board, on own motion, can declare that an impasse exists, it must determine that the party claiming impasse has been negotiating in good faith.\u00a0 56 H. 85, 528 P.2d 809.\n\u00a0 Based on plain language of section and collective bargaining agreement grievance procedure, plaintiff needed to pursue any claims arising from the agreement in the administrative forum rather than in circuit court.\u00a0 92 H. 268, 990 P.2d 1150.\n\u00a0 Where employee was not the exclusive representative of an appropriate bargaining unit and, thus, subsection (a) did not confer any right to submit employee's dispute to an agreed procedure or to the board for a final and binding decision, the board was correct in dismissing employee's claim, and there was no \u00a789-13(a)(7) prohibited practice refusal or failure to comply with chapter 89 by the employer.\u00a0 97 H. 528, 40 P.3d 930.\n\u00a0 Subsection (a) does not limit the Hawaii labor relations board's authority to intervene when a party commits a prohibited practice by refusing to comply with the alternative impasse procedure.\u00a0 132 H. 492 (App.), 323 P.3d 136 (2014).\n\u00a0 Where neither the government-employee union (union) nor the government employers challenged the terms of the arbitration award or sought to invalidate the arbitration award and where the union filed a motion in circuit court to confirm the arbitration award, the issues raised on appeal by the union relating to the selection of the neutral arbitrator were moot.\u00a0 However, the issues of whether the Hawaii labor relations board (board) or the circuit court had original jurisdiction to resolve the dispute over the selection of the neutral arbitrator and whether the board exceeded its authority in issuing its order for interlocutory relief fell within the public interest exception to the mootness doctrine.\u00a0 132 H. 492 (App.), 323 P.3d 136 (2014).\n\u00a0 Where the government-employee union's (union) claim that the government employers violated the terms of the arbitration award by failing to meet and confer as required by the arbitration award involved a controversy concerning prohibited practices, the Hawaii labor relations board had exclusive original jurisdiction over the claims raised in the union's motion for civil contempt, and the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to decide the motion for civil contempt.\u00a0 132 H. 492 (App.), 323 P.3d 136 (2014).\n\u00a0 Where the parties' actions precluded the arbitration from commencing on the date agreed upon under a memorandum of agreement and threatened the timely resolution of the impasse, the Hawaii labor relations board did not abuse its discretion in facilitating a timely resolution of the parties' stalemate in selecting a neutral arbitrator by having the American Arbitration Association select the neutral arbitrator.\u00a0 132 H. 492 (App.), 323 P.3d 136 (2014).\n\u00a0 Where the parties' claims regarding their dispute over the selection of a neutral arbitrator, as alleged in their prohibited practice complaints, clearly involved a controversy concerning prohibited practices, the Hawaii labor relations board had exclusive original jurisdiction to determine the controversy concerning the selection of the neutral arbitrator.\u00a0 132 H. 492 (App.), 323 P.3d 136 (2014)."
