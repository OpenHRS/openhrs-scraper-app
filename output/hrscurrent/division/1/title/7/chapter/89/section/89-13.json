[L 1970, c 171, pt of \u00a72; gen ch 1985; am L 1992, c 214, \u00a73; am L 2003, c 3, \u00a72]\n\u00a0\nAttorney General Opinions\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Unilateral wage increases by employer pending representation elections as constituting interference, restraint or coercion.\u00a0 Att. Gen. Op. 74-6.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Where nothing in the record suggested that plaintiff took plaintiff's matter to the Hawaii labor relations board, and, at most, plaintiff raised issues before the merit appeals board, the court was without authority to address any alleged violation of what plaintiff said were plaintiff's rights to be treated as something other than an at-will employee under the collective bargaining agreement.\u00a0 937 F. Supp. 2d 1220 (2013).\n\u00a0 Only interference with a lawful employee activity may be subject of a prohibited practice charge under subsection (a)(1).\u00a0 60 H. 361, 590 P.2d 993.\n\u00a0 To prove a prohibited practice under subsection (b), a conscious, knowing, and deliberate intent to violate the provisions of chapter 89 must be proven.\u00a0 66 H. 401, 664 P.2d 727.\n\u00a0 The broad policy statements within \u00a789-1 do not impose binding duties or obligations upon any parties but, rather, provide a useful guide for determining legislative intent and purpose; these statements, therefore, do not implicate the prohibited practice provision of refusing or failing to comply with any provision of chapter 89, as set forth in subsection (a)(7); thus, employee's claim that employer violated \u00a789-1 properly dismissed.\u00a0 97 H. 528, 40 P.3d 930.\n\u00a0 Where employee presented grievance to employer, was heard with respect thereto, and was notified that the remedy employee sought as an individual was denied, employer did not violate \u00a789-8(b) and the board was correct in determining that, on the relevant undisputed facts, the employer was entitled to summary judgment; thus, there was no subsection (a)(7) or (8) prohibited practice violation of the collective bargaining agreement.\u00a0 97 H. 528, 40 P.3d 930.\n\u00a0\u00a0Where employee was not the exclusive representative of an appropriate bargaining unit and, thus, \u00a789-11(a) did not confer any right to submit employee's dispute to an agreed procedure or to the board for a final and binding decision, the board was correct in dismissing employee's claim, and there was no subsection (a)(7) prohibited practice refusal or failure to comply with chapter 89 by the employer.\u00a0 97 H. 528, 40 P.3d 930.\n\u00a0 Although an application of \u00a784-13 was necessary to decide the union's complaint under this section, it could not be said that the question arose under chapter 84; where union filed the complaint with the board under \u00a789-19, the board had \"exclusive original jurisdiction\" to determine prohibited practice complaints and the ethics commission would not have had jurisdiction to make that determination; thus, the board had the power to apply \u00a784-13 in order to decide whether a prohibited practice\u00a0 violation actually occurred and it did not exceed its jurisdiction in ruling that a violation did not occur based on the application of \u00a784-13.\u00a0 116 H. 73, 170 P.3d 324.\n\u00a0 Circuit court erred by failing to allow the Hawaii labor relations board to decide the issues relating to chapter 89 before deciding the constitutional issues in the case where the plain language of \u00a789-14 supported the conclusion that the board had exclusive original jurisdiction over the plaintiffs' claims and that the case was a \"controversy concerning prohibited practices\" that must first be submitted to the board.\u00a0 126 H. 318, 271 P.3d 613.\n\u00a0 The Hawaii labor relations board had jurisdiction to declare whether the factual circumstances presented to it in the union's amended petition would constitute a prohibited practice, where the amended petition sought a declaratory ruling that the employers' service of subpoenas duces tecum interfered with, restrained, and otherwise violated the employees' rights under \u00a789-3, and therefore constituted prohibited practices pursuant to subsection (a)(1).\u00a0 131 H. 142 (App.), 315 P.3d 768 (2013)."
