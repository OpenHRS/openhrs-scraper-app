Gen. Op. 72-10.\n\u00a0 Legislature may reject cost items by failure to appropriate funds or by concurrent resolution or other means indicating views of both houses.\u00a0 Att. Gen. Op. 72-10.\n\u00a0 Legislature has power to pass law increasing salaries of one unit of state employees, but it would be inconsistent with the collective bargaining law to do so.\u00a0 Att. Gen. Op. 74-6.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 In interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement, extrinsic evidence of past practices and past interpretations is proper.\u00a0 60 H. 513, 591 P.2d 621."
