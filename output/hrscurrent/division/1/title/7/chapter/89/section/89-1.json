[L 1970, c 171, pt of \u00a72; am L 1985, c 251, \u00a72; am L 2000, c 253, \u00a792]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 The broad policy statements within this section do not impose binding duties or obligations upon any parties but, rather, provide a useful guide for determining legislative intent and purpose; these statements, therefore, do not implicate the prohibited practice provision of refusing or failing to comply with any provision of chapter 89, as set forth in \u00a789-13(a)(7); thus, employee's claim that employer violated this section properly dismissed.\u00a0 97 H. 528, 40 P.3d 930.\n\u00a0 Order by Hawaii public employment relations board not in concert with policy and goals of collective bargaining, and constituted abuse of discretion.\u00a0 5 H. App. 533, 704 P.2d 917."
