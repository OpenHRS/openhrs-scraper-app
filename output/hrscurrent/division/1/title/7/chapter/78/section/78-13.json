[L 1961, c 130, \u00a71; am L 1963, c 60, \u00a71; Supp, \u00a75-14.5; HRS \u00a778-13; am L 1974, c 129, \u00a71; am L 1996, c 80, \u00a71; am L 1997, c 355, \u00a71; am L 1998, c 109, \u00a71 and c 110, \u00a73]\n\u00a0\nRevision Note\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Subsection (e) redesignated pursuant to \u00a723G-15(1).\n\u00a0\nAttorney General Opinions\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Payments on biweekly rather than on semimonthly basis held valid.\u00a0 Att. Gen. Op. 64-11.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 District court did not abuse its discretion in granting plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, where court granted a preliminary injunction against operation of Act 355, L 1997 (which amended this section), State's \"pay lag\" law, on the ground that it impaired the obligations of the employees' collective bargaining agreement in violation of the contract clause of the U.S. Constitution.\u00a0 183 F.3d 1096.\n\u00a0 Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction granted, where plaintiffs filed motion seeking to enjoin defendants from delaying payroll under Act 355, L 1997 (which amended this section), with respect to University of Hawaii faculty members, arguing that Act 355 violated the contract clause of the U.S. Constitution because a five-day delay in pay violated the collective bargaining agreement between the State and the faculty members at the University.\u00a0 16 F. Supp. 2d 1242.\n\u00a0 Where there was no existing contract that Act 355, L 1997 (amending this section), impaired, no contracts clause violation possible and injunction no longer needed; the case was moot.\u00a0 125 F. Supp. 2d 1237.\n\u00a0 Based upon the legislative history of this section, and where it could not be said that the objective of Act 355, L 1997, which was to balance the state budget by amending this section, was not achieved, the specific implementation dates set forth in this section were mandatory.\u00a0 111 H. 168, 140 P.3d 401.\n\u00a0 The Act 355, L 1997 amendment to this section, which essentially altered the dates when public employees are to be paid, did not violate article XIII, \u00a72 of the Hawaii constitution nor chapter 89 inasmuch as they did not prohibit a state employer from changing the pay dates of its employees; thus, the Act 355 amendment was not unconstitutional.\u00a0 111 H. 168, 140 P.3d 401.\n\u00a0 Where plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that bargaining over pay dates was one of the core subjects of collective bargaining that triggers a violation of article XIII, \u00a72 of the Hawaii constitution, and failed to provide the supreme court with their collective bargaining agreement to support their contention that pay dates are bargainable, and these pay dates were not specifically incorporated into their contract, the Act 355, L 1997 amendment to this section to unilaterally alter the \"traditional practice\" of being paid on the fifteenth day and last day of the month did not violate their right to collectively bargain pay periods.\u00a0 111 H. 168, 140 P.3d 401."
