and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 The right of the officer to deduct from each and every periodic payment normally due the assignor an amount equal to the maximum legally permissible amount deductible under garnishment law until the total amount owing is paid in full.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For purposes of this section, a person shall be deemed to waive the hearing if the person fails to request a hearing within fifteen days from the date the person was notified of the indebtedness and the opportunity to request a hearing.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (d)\u00a0 The operation of all garnishment process served upon the disbursing officer shall be stayed until the indebtedness has been fully paid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (e)\u00a0 If the indebtedness has occurred as a result of salary or wage overpayment, the disbursing officer shall determine the amount of indebtedness and notify the employee in writing of the indebtedness; provided that, to be an actionable cause of action, the determination and notice to the employee shall be made within two years from the date of the salary or wage overpayment, and not after.\u00a0 If the employee contests the disbursing officer's determination of indebtedness, the employee may request a hearing pursuant to chapter 91.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (f)\u00a0 Regardless of whether a contested determination of indebtedness is pending, the disbursing officer shall commence immediate recovery of the indebtedness as provided in this subsection.\u00a0 If the indebtedness is equal to or less than $1,000, the disbursing officer shall immediately deduct from any subsequent periodic payment normally due the employee any amount up to the total amount of indebtedness and for indebtedness greater than $1,000, the disbursing officer shall deduct:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 An amount agreed to by the employee and the appointing authority, but not less than $100 per pay period;

provided that credits shall not be applied to any extent that would require a refund of any moneys already deducted or repaid or that would require the payment of any moneys to the employee equivalent to a cashing out of leave or compensatory time credits.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (g)\u00a0 If the determination of indebtedness was contested and is subsequently found to be incorrect:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 Any moneys repaid or deducted under subsection (e) for any indebtedness in excess of the correct amount shall be promptly refunded with interest as specified by section 103-10; or\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 All leave or compensatory time credits applied to offset any indebtedness in excess of the correct amount shall be re-credited to the employee's respective leave or compensatory time accounts and shall not result in a cash payment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (h)\u00a0 If an employee is entitled to contest the determination of indebtedness under a collective bargaining grievance procedure, that procedure shall be used in lieu of a hearing under subsection (e).\u00a0 A collective bargaining agreement may include overpayment recovery procedures; provided that the parties do not agree on any provision that would be inconsistent with subsections (f) and (g).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (i)\u00a0 Where an officer, agent, employee, or other person in the service of a jurisdiction is compensated in an amount greater than or less than that to which the person is entitled, the determination of the officer's, agent's, employee's, or other person's average final compensation for the period of indebtedness shall be calculated in accordance with section 88-81; provided that the compensation used to calculate the average final compensation shall be the compensation the officer, agent, employee, or other person should have been paid during that period.
