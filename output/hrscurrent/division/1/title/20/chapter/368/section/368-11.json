Supp. 2d 1210 (2006).\n\u00a0 The \"single-filing\" or \"piggyback\" rule applied under Hawaii law, where the \"dual-filed\" equal employment opportunity commission administrative complaints of four plaintiffs-intervenors were filed after the 180-day deadline in subsection (c) and the plaintiffs-intervenors sought to \"piggyback\" on the timely administrative complaints of three other plaintiffs-intervenors.\u00a0 504 F. Supp. 2d 1008 (2007).\n\u00a0 Where original complaint was timely filed under subsection (c), amendment of complaint pursuant to Hawaii administrative rule \u00a712-46-6.1 to add agent of employer responsible for alleged discriminatory conduct also did not violate statute of limitations under this section.\u00a0 89 H. 269, 971 P.2d 1104 (1999)."
