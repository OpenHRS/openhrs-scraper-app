Section 112 (1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime.\u00a0 It is the purpose of this compact and the interstate commission created hereunder, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states, to:\u00a0 provide the framework for the promotion of public safety and protect the rights of victims through the control and regulation of the interstate movement of offenders in the community; provide for the effective tracking, supervision, and rehabilitation of these offenders by the sending and receiving states; and to equitably distribute the costs, benefits and obligations of the compact among the compacting states.\u00a0 In addition, this compact will create an interstate commission which will establish uniform procedures to manage the movement between states of adults placed under community supervision and released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, paroling authorities, corrections or other criminal justice agencies which will promulgate rules to achieve the purpose of this compact; ensure an opportunity for input and timely notice to victims and to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines; establish a system of uniform data collection, access to information on active cases by authorized criminal justice officials, and regular reporting of compact activities to heads of state councils, state executive, judicial, and legislative branches and criminal justice administrators; monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of offenders and initiate interventions to address and correct noncompliance; and coordinate training and education regarding regulations of interstate movement of offenders for officials involved in such activity.\u00a0 The compacting states recognize that there is no \"right\" of any offender to live in another state and that duly accredited officers of a sending state may at all times enter a receiving state and there apprehend and retake any offender under supervision subject to the provisions of this compact and bylaws and rules promulgated hereunder.\u00a0 It is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the interstate commission created herein are the formation of public policies and are therefore public business.\n\u00a0\nARTICLE II\nDEFINITIONS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As used in this compact, unless the context clearly requires a different

including any obligations, the performance of which extend beyond the effective date of withdrawal.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (e)\u00a0 Reinstatement following withdrawal of any compacting state shall

reasonable by the interstate commission;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 Remedial training and technical assistance as directed by the interstate commission; and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (3)\u00a0 Suspension and termination of membership in the compact.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b)\u00a0 Suspension shall be imposed only after all other reasonable means of securing compliance under the bylaws and rules have been exhausted.\u00a0 Immediate notice of suspension shall be given by the interstate commission to the governor, the chief justice of the state; the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and the state council.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (c)\u00a0 The grounds for default include, but are not limited to, failure of a compacting state to perform such obligations or responsibilities imposed upon it by this compact, interstate commission bylaws, or duly promulgated rules.\u00a0 The interstate commission shall immediately notify the defaulting state in writing of the penalty imposed by the interstate commission on the defaulting state pending a cure of the default.\u00a0 The interstate commission shall stipulate the conditions and the time period within which the defaulting state must cure its default.\u00a0 If the defaulting state fails to cure the default within the time period specified by the interstate commission, in

commission shall notify the governor, the chief justice and the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature and the state council of such termination.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (d)\u00a0 The defaulting state is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination including any obligations, the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of termination.\u00a0 The interstate commission shall not bear any costs relating to the defaulting state unless otherwise mutually agreed upon between the interstate commission and the defaulting state.\u00a0 Reinstatement following termination of any compacting state requires both a reenactment of the compact by the defaulting state and the approval of the interstate commission pursuant to the rules.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Section C.\u00a0 Judicial enforcement.\u00a0 The interstate commission, by majority vote of the members, may initiate

offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact, its duly promulgated rules and bylaws, against any compacting state in default.\u00a0 In the event judicial enforcement is necessary the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorneys fees.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Section D.\u00a0 Dissolution of compact.\u00a0 The compact dissolves effective upon the date of the withdrawal or default of the compacting state which reduces membership in the compact to one compacting state.\u00a0 Upon the dissolution of this compact, the compact becomes void and shall be of no further effect, and the business and affairs of the interstate commission shall be wound up and any surplus funds shall be distributed in accordance with the bylaws.\n\u00a0\nARTICLE XIII\nSEVERABILITY AND CONSTRUCTION\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The provisions of this compact shall be severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision is deemed unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the compact shall be enforceable.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The provisions of this compact shall be liberally constructed to effectuate its purposes.\n\u00a0\nARTICLE XIV\nBINDING EFFECT OF COMPACT AND OTHER LAWS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Section A.\u00a0 Other laws.\u00a0 Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a compacting state that is not inconsistent with this compact.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All compacting states' laws conflicting with this compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Section B.\u00a0 Binding-effect of the compact.\u00a0 (a)\u00a0 All lawful actions of the interstate commission, including all rules and bylaws promulgated by the interstate commission, are binding upon the compacting states.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b)\u00a0 All agreements between the interstate commission and the compacting states are binding in accordance with their terms.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (c)\u00a0 Upon the request of a party to a conflict over meaning or interpretation of interstate commission actions, and upon a majority vote of the compacting states, the interstate commission may issue advisory opinions regarding such meaning or interpretation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (d)\u00a0 In the event any provision of this compact exceeds the constitutional limits imposed on the legislature of any compacting state, the obligations, duties, powers, or jurisdiction sought to be conferred by those provisions upon the interstate commission shall be ineffective and those obligations, duties, powers, or jurisdiction shall remain in the compacting state and shall be exercised by the agency thereof to which the obligations, duties, powers, or jurisdiction are delegated by law in effect at the time this compact becomes effective.
