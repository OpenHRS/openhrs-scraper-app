\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 The federally qualified health center or rural health clinic submits data, documentation, and schedules that substantiate any changes in services and the related adjustment of reasonable costs following medicare principles of reimbursement; and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (3)\u00a0 The federally qualified health center or rural health clinic proposes a projected adjusted rate within one hundred fifty days of the changes to the scope of services.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b)\u00a0 This proposed projected adjusted rate is subject to departmental approval.\u00a0 The proposed projected adjusted rate shall be calculated based on a consolidated basis where the federally qualified health center or rural health clinic takes all costs for the center that would include both the costs included in the base rate, as well as the additional costs, provided that the federally qualified health center or rural health clinic calculated the baseline prospective payment system rate based on total consolidated costs.\u00a0 A net change in the federally qualified health center's or rural health clinic's rate shall be calculated by subtracting the federally qualified health center's or rural health clinic's previously assigned prospective payment system rate from its projected adjusted rate.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (c)\u00a0 Within one hundred twenty days of its receipt of the projected adjusted rate and all additional documentation requested by the department, the department shall notify the federally qualified health center or rural health clinic of its acceptance or rejection of the projected adjusted rate.\u00a0 Upon approval by the department, the federally qualified health center or rural health clinic shall be paid the projected rate, which shall be effective from the date of the change in scope of services through the date that a rate is calculated based upon the first full fiscal year that includes the change in scope of services.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (d)\u00a0 The department shall review the calculated rate of the first full fiscal year cost report if the change of scope of service is reflected in more than six months of the report.\u00a0 For those federally qualified health centers or rural health clinics in which the change of scope of services is in effect for six months or less of the cost report fiscal year, review of the next full fiscal year cost report also is required.\u00a0 The department shall review the calculated inflated weighted average rate of these two cost reports.\u00a0 The total costs of the first year report shall be adjusted to the Medical Economic Index of the second year report.\u00a0 Each report shall be weighted based upon number of patient encounters.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (e)\u00a0 Upon receipt of the cost reports, the prospective payment system rate shall be adjusted following a review by the fiscal agent of the cost reports and documentation.\u00a0 Adjustments shall be made for payments for the period from the effective date of the change in scope of services through the date of the final adjustment of the prospective payment system rate.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (f)\u00a0 For the purposes of prospective payment system rate adjustment, a change in scope of services provided by a federally qualified health center or rural health clinic means the following:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 The addition of a new service, such as adding dental services or any other medicaid covered service, that is not incorporated in the baseline prospective payment system rate or a deletion of a service that is incorporated in the baseline prospective payment system rate;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 A change in service resulting from amended regulatory requirements or rules;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (3)\u00a0 A change in service resulting from relocation;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (4)\u00a0 A change in type, intensity, duration, or amount of service resulting from a change in applicable technology and medical practice used;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (5)\u00a0 An increase in service intensity, duration, or amount of service resulting from changes in the types of patients served, including but not limited to populations with human immunodeficiency virus, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or other chronic diseases, or homeless, elderly, migrant, or other special populations;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (6)\u00a0 A change in service resulting from a change in the provider mix of a federally qualified health center or a rural health clinic or one of its sites;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (7)\u00a0 Any changes in the scope of a project approved by the federal Health Resources and Services Administration where the change affects a covered service;
