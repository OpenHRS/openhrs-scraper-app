entered into by the authority of or pursuant thereto, and nothing in any such contract shall be inconsistent therewith.\n\u00a0\nARTICLE IV\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (a)\u00a0 Whenever the appropriate authority in a state party to this compact, and which has entered into a contract pursuant to article III, shall decide that confinement in, or transfer of an inmate to, an institution within the territory of another party state is necessary or desirable in order to provide adequate quarters and care or an appropriate program of rehabilitation or treatment, the appropriate authority may direct that the confinement be within an institution within the territory of the other party state, the receiving state to act in that regard solely as agent for the sending state.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b)\u00a0 The appropriate officials of any state party to this compact shall have access, at all reasonable times, to any institution in which it has a contractual

confined in an institution pursuant to the terms of this compact shall at all times be subject to the jurisdiction of the sending state and may at any time be removed therefrom for transfer to a

pursuant to the terms of any contract entered into under the terms of article III.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (d)\u00a0 Each receiving state shall provide regular reports to each sending state on the inmates of that sending state in institutions pursuant to this compact including a conduct record of each inmate and certify that record to the authority designated by the sending state, in order that each inmate may have official review of the inmate's record in determining and altering the disposition of the inmate in accordance with the law which may obtain in the sending state and in order that the same may be a source of information for the sending state.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (e)\u00a0 All inmates who may be confined in an institution pursuant to the provisions of this compact shall be treated in a reasonable and humane manner and shall be treated equally with such similar inmates of the receiving state as may be confined in the same institution.\u00a0 The fact of confinement in a receiving state shall not deprive any inmate so confined of any legal rights which said inmate would have had if confined in an appropriate institution of the sending state.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (f)\u00a0 Any hearing or hearings to which an inmate confined pursuant to this compact may be entitled by the laws of the sending state may be had before the appropriate authority of the sending state, or of the receiving state if authorized by the sending state.\u00a0 The receiving state shall provide adequate facilities for such hearings as may be conducted by appropriate authority of a sending state.\u00a0 In the event such hearing or hearings are had before an authority of the receiving state, the governing law shall be that of the sending state and a record of the hearing or

hearing would have been had if it had taken place in the sending state.\u00a0 In any and all proceedings had pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision, the authority of the receiving state shall act solely as agent of the sending state and no final determination shall be made in any matter except by the appropriate authority of the sending state.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (g)\u00a0 Any inmate confined pursuant to this compact shall be released within the territory of the sending state unless the inmate, and the sending and receiving states, shall agree upon release in some other place.\u00a0 The sending state shall bear the cost of such return to its territory.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (h)\u00a0 Any inmate confined pursuant to the terms of this compact shall have any and all rights to participate in and derive any benefits or incur or be relieved of any obligations or have such obligations modified or the inmate's status changed on account of any action or proceeding in which the inmate could have participated if confined in any appropriate institution of the sending state located within such state.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (i)\u00a0 The parent, guardian, trustee, or other person or persons entitled under the laws of the sending state to act for, advise, or otherwise function with respect to any inmate shall not be deprived of or restricted in the person's exercise of any power in respect of any inmate confined pursuant to the terms of this compact.\n\u00a0\nARTICLE V\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (a)\u00a0 Any decision of the sending state in respect of any matter over which it retains jurisdiction pursuant to this compact shall be conclusive upon and not reviewable within the receiving state, but if at the time the sending state seeks to remove an inmate from an institution in the receiving state there is pending against the inmate within such state any criminal charge or if the inmate is formally accused of having committed within such state a criminal offense, the inmate shall not be returned without the consent of the receiving state until discharged from prosecution or other form of proceeding, imprisonment, or detention for such offense.\u00a0 The duly accredited officers of the sending state shall be permitted to transport inmates pursuant to this compact through any and all states party to this compact without interference.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b)\u00a0 An inmate who escapes from an institution in which the inmate is confined pursuant to this compact shall be deemed a fugitive from the sending state and from the state in which the institution is situated.\u00a0 In the case of an escape to a jurisdiction other than the sending or receiving state, the responsibility for institution of extradition or rendition proceedings shall be that of the sending state, but nothing contained herein shall be constructed to prevent or affect the activities of officers and agencies of any jurisdiction directed toward the apprehension and return of an escapee.\n\u00a0\nARTICLE VI\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Any state party to this compact may accept federal aid for use in connection with any institution or program, the use of which is or may be affected by this compact or any contract pursuant hereto and any inmate in a receiving state pursuant to this compact may participate in any such federally aided program or activity for which the sending and receiving states have made contractual provision, provided that if such program or activity is not part of the customary correctional regimen, the express consent of the appropriate authority of the sending state shall be required therefor.\n\u00a0\nARTICLE VII\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This compact shall enter into force and become effective and binding upon the states so acting when it has been enacted into law by any two states.\u00a0 Thereafter, this compact shall enter into force and become effective and binding as to any other of said states upon similar action by such state.\n\u00a0\nARTICLE VIII\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon a party state until it shall have enacted a statute repealing the same and providing for the sending of formal written notice of withdrawal from the compact to the appropriate authority of all other party states.\u00a0 An actual withdrawal shall not take effect until one year after the notices provided in said statute have been sent.\u00a0 Such withdrawal shall not relieve the withdrawing state from its obligations assumed hereunder prior to the effective date of withdrawal.\u00a0 Before the effective date of withdrawal, a withdrawing state shall remove to its territory at its own expense, such inmates as it may have confined pursuant to the provisions of this compact.\n\u00a0\nARTICLE IX\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to abrogate or impair any agreement or other arrangement which a party state may have with a nonparty state for the confinement, rehabilitation, or treatment of inmates nor to repeal any other laws of a party state authorizing the making of cooperative institutional arrangements.\n\u00a0\nARTICLE X\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed and shall be severable.\u00a0 If any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any participating state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.\u00a0 If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state participating therein, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.
