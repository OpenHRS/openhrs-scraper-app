App. 543, 812 P.2d 1199 (1991).\n\u00a0 Where there was no rational basis for board's refusing to consider additional evidence submitted by claimant, and no cogent explanation for board's failure to consider evidence in light of its direct effect on board's finding and conclusion, board abused its discretion in denying claimant's motion to reopen case.\u00a0 93 H. 116 (App.), 997 P.2d 42 (2000).\n\u00a0 Claimant's appeal of director's decision was untimely where appeal was not filed for that decision within twenty-day deadline as required under subsection (a), notwithstanding that other issues were yet to be decided.\u00a0 98 H. 508 (App.), 51 P.3d 375 (2002).\n\u00a0 At the time plaintiff's appeals matured, where plaintiff was precluded by Hawaii administrative rule \u00a712-15-94(d) from appealing the director's decisions to the labor and industrial relations appeals board, plaintiff could not be faulted for failing to file notices of appeal with the board within the twenty-day time limit as required by this section; thus, plaintiff was given twenty days from the effective date of this judgment to file appeals of the director's decisions with the board.\u00a0 120 H. 101 (App.), 201 P.3d 614 (2009).\n\u00a0 Section 386-73 and this section set forth the right to appeal from the decisions of the director in workers' compensation cases and it gives a party the right to appeal the decision of the director in a medical fee dispute to the labor and industrial relations appeals board; thus, the no-appeal provision of Hawaii administrative rule \u00a712-15-94(d) was invalid as inconsistent with this chapter, and the director exceeded the director's rulemaking authority in making the director's decisions in medical fee disputes final and non-appealable.\u00a0 120 H. 101 (App.), 201 P.3d 614 (2009).\n\u00a0 Petitioner's September 7, 2010 appeal was timely, where petitioner's June 14, 2010 letter to the disability compensation division (DCD) objecting to the director's approval of petitioner's attorney's fees and requesting a hearing, followed by petitioner's subsequent letters, was an application to reopen the case pursuant to \u00a7386-89(a) to permit the introduction of newly discovered evidence and the DCD's August 30, 2010 letter was the director's final decision denying the application to reopen the case.\u00a0 132 H. 320, 321 P.3d 671 (2014).\n\u00a0 Cited:\u00a0 27 H. 431, 433 (1923); 31 H. 672, 676 (1930); 31 H. 814, 815 (1931); 32 H. 699, 700 (1933); 32 H. 928 (1933); 37 H. 556 (1947); 37 H. 583 (1947); 39 H. 258 (1952)."
