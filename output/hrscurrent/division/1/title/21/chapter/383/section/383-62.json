department shall establish a group account for such employers effective as of the beginning of the calendar quarter in which the department receives the application, and it shall notify the group's representative of the effective date of the account.\u00a0 Such account shall remain in effect for not less than two years and thereafter until terminated at the discretion of the department or upon
