Supp. 2d 914 (2011).\n\u00a0 Hawaii courts should be given discretion to enhance the lodestar fee when an attorney has been retained on a contingency fee basis; a \"reasonable fee\" under Hawaii fee-shifting statutes is an amount of fees that \"would attract competent counsel\", in light of all the circumstances, and that under certain circumstances the lodestar fee may be multiplied by a factor to achieve a \"reasonable\" award of fees.\u00a0 96 H. 408, 32 P.3d 52 (2001).\n\u00a0 Where a court awards attorney's fees pursuant to fee-shifting statutes in cases involving contingency fee arrangements, a trial judge should not be limited by the contingency fee arrangement between a plaintiff and his or her counsel in determining a reasonable fee; plaintiff is thus not necessarily barred from recovery of a doubled lodestar fee.\u00a0 96 H. 408, 32 P.3d 52 (2001)."
