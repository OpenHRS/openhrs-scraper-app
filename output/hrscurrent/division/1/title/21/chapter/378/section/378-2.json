Supp. 1229 (1983).\n\u00a0 Plaintiff alleged that employer contravened letter and purpose of section.\u00a0 737 F. Supp. 1104 (1990).\n\u00a0 Purpose is to protect claimants under workers' compensation law.\u00a0 749 F. Supp. 1023 (1990).\n\u00a0 Because this section and \u00a7378-62 did not contain limitation periods, court invoked State's general personal injury statute of limitations, \u00a7657-7; plaintiff's state law claims barred where neither the collective bargaining proceedings nor the equal employment opportunity commission proceedings tolled the statute of limitations.\u00a0 874 F. Supp. 1095 (1994).\n\u00a0 Plaintiff brought forth evidence of a continuing series of conduct which affected plaintiff and plaintiff's work environment; plaintiff's sexual harassment claims may proceed using the evidence, even though much of it predated limitations period; plaintiff may not rely on other proffered evidence because to extent those actions raised claims, statute of limitations had passed.\u00a0 125 F. Supp. 2d 1224 (2000).\n\u00a0 Defendant could not be liable in defendant's individual capacity under paragraph (1)(A).\u00a0 159 F. Supp. 2d 1211 (2001).\n\u00a0 Plaintiff with diabetes was not substantially limited in any major life activity and, therefore, was not disabled under this section or the ADA.\u00a0 161 F. Supp. 2d 1135 (2000).\n\u00a0 Plaintiff asserted discrimination claims against plaintiff's supervisor and employer, and the alleged parent company of the employer, pursuant to chapter 378 and federal law. Defendants' motion for partial dismissal or alternatively, for partial summary judgment granted in part (e.g., claims based on national origin and aiding and abetting) and denied in part (e.g., claims based on color).\u00a0 322 F. Supp. 2d 1101 (2004).\n\u00a0 Defendant limited partner's motion to dismiss granted; among other things, plaintiff did not allege sufficient facts in the second amended complaint that would establish defendant's liability under paragraph (3).\u00a0 351 F. Supp. 2d 1025 (2004).\n\u00a0 Individuals are subject to liability under this section when they act as agents of an employer.\u00a0 396 F. Supp. 2d 1138 (2005).\n\u00a0 Based on the plain language of \u00a7378-1 and paragraph (2), plaintiff may not proceed under paragraph (2) against defendant, an individual employee.\u00a0 Plaintiff stated no claim under paragraph (3), where plaintiff claimed that defendant had incited, compelled, or coerced defendant into discriminating.\u00a0 405 F. Supp. 2d 1225 (2005).\n\u00a0 Summary judgment granted for defendants (plaintiff's former employer and former supervisor) regarding plaintiff's state law sexual harassment claim brought pursuant to this section, where plaintiff did not meet the statutory filing deadline pursuant to chapter 378 or the tort statute of limitations for the claim.\u00a0 468 F. Supp. 2d 1210 (2006).\n\u00a0 The \"single-filing\" or \"piggyback\" rule applied under Hawaii law, where the \"dual-filed\" equal employment opportunity commission administrative complaints of four plaintiffs-intervenors were filed after the 180-day deadline in \u00a7368-11(c) and the plaintiffs-intervenors sought to \"piggyback\" on the timely administrative complaints of three other plaintiffs-intervenors.\u00a0 504 F. Supp. 2d 1008 (2007).\n\u00a0\u00a0Where plaintiffs-intervenors' intentional infliction of emotional distress/negligent infliction of emotional distress claims were premised on a violation of this section, which provides a nonnegotiable state right, and the alleged conduct at issue involved discrimination on the basis of national origin and religion, the claims were not preempted by \u00a7301 of the Labor Management Relations Act.\u00a0 535 F. Supp. 2d 1149 (2008).\n\u00a0 Plaintiff asserted claims for violation of Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and this section; plaintiff did not establish a genuine issue of material fact that plaintiff was disabled pursuant to any of the definitions of \"disability\" pursuant to the ADA and this section.\u00a0 586 F. Supp. 2d 1213 (2008).\n\u00a0 Pre-2011 amendment to subsection (1):\u00a0 Hawaii supreme court would apply the test prescribed by the United States Supreme Court in Oncale in evaluating same-sex harassment and whether or not same-sex harassment constitutes discrimination \"because of sex\" under this section.\u00a0 721 F. Supp. 2d 947 (2010).\n\u00a0 The Hawaii supreme court in French did not demonstrate a clear attempt to keep Hawaii law distinct from the federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) such that a claim under the Hawaii discrimination law raises issues sufficiently distinct from an ADA claim so as to prevent application of the first-to-file-rule.\u00a0 728 F. Supp. 2d 1096 (2010).\n\u00a0 For Eleventh Amendment purposes, a suit against a state official in that official's capacity is no different from a suit against the State itself; Hawaii has not consented to suit in federal court for chapter 378 claims, and sovereign immunity thus barred plaintiff teacher's claims under this section against the Hawaii department of education and the department of education superintendent in the superintendent's official capacity.\u00a0 855 F. Supp. 2d 1155 (2012).\n\u00a0 Where plaintiff claimed defendants aided and abetted the commission of a discriminatory act prohibited by this chapter, plaintiff's second amended complaint sufficiently pled factual allegations that stated a plausible argument that defendants acted with malice.\u00a0 892 F. Supp. 2d 1245 (2012).\n\u00a0 Defendant's motion for summary judgment on plaintiff's claims under paragraph (3) (2008) denied, where there were genuine issues of material fact whether some of the conduct alleged by plaintiff resulted in an adverse employment action.\u00a0 907 F. Supp. 2d 1143 (2012).\n\u00a0 Plaintiff could pursue claims under paragraph (3) (2008) against defendants even though they were not named respondents in the equal employment opportunity commission (EEOC) charges, where:\u00a0 (1) the county, a named respondent in the charges, and defendant prosecuting attorney were substantially identical parties and plaintiff had listed defendant as one of the persons responsible for the alleged discrimination against plaintiff in the EEOC questionnaire; and (2) other defendant was involved in the acts giving rise to the claims in the charges. \u00a0907 F. Supp. 2d 1143 (2012).\n\u00a0 Where defendants argued that plaintiff did not exhaust administrative remedies as to claims under paragraph (3) (2008) because the aid and abet allegation was not contained in any of plaintiff's equal employment opportunity commission charges, plaintiff's claims were reasonably related to allegations in the charge to the extent those claims were consistent with certain claims expressly alleged against the county.\u00a0 907 F. Supp. 2d 1143 (2012).\n\u00a0 An age-based remark not made directly in the context of an employment decision or uttered by a non-decisionmaker may be relevant, circumstantial evidence of discrimination.\u00a0 However, the court did not find a relationship between the remarks and the employment practices at issue that was sufficient to establish discriminatory animus.\u00a0 919 F. Supp. 2d 1101 (2013).\n\u00a0 Plaintiff made a prima facie case of age and sex discrimination by demonstrating that plaintiff:\u00a0 (1) belonged to a protected class (male and 59 years old during the relevant time period); (2) performed the job adequately; (3) suffered an adverse employment action; and (4) a similarly situated, younger, female employee was treated differently.\u00a0 However, defendant was entitled to summary judgment on plaintiff's age and sex discrimination claims where plaintiff did not establish that defendant's legitimate business reasons for selecting the younger, female candidate were pretextual.\u00a0 919 F. Supp. 2d 1101 (2013).\n\u00a0 Defendant's motion for summary judgment denied where plaintiff raised genuine issue of material fact as to whether plaintiff's demotion was a result of national origin/ancestry or age discrimination.\u00a0 Even though plaintiff was not actually from Mexico, plaintiff may maintain a \"perceived as\" national origin claim if plaintiff was discriminated against based on characteristics that led others to connect plaintiff to Mexico, such as plaintiff's accent.\u00a0 Supervisor's alleged references to \"old bags\" and \"old clunkers\", combined with statements such as \"you old people don't learn\", raised an issue of fact as to whether supervisor had an animus toward older individuals that may have played a role in supervisor's decision to demote plaintiff.\u00a0 927 F. Supp. 2d 978 (2013).\n\u00a0 Defendant's motion for summary judgment granted as to plaintiff's retaliation claims where plaintiff failed to identify the adverse employment action plaintiff suffered in retaliation for plaintiff's exercise of rights, and further, there was no causal link between the supposed adverse employment action and plaintiff's exercise of rights.\u00a0 927 F. Supp. 2d 978 (2013).\n\u00a0 Plaintiff failed to demonstrate a prima facie case of sex discrimination because plaintiff failed to identify any similarly situated person outside of plaintiff's protected class who was treated more favorably.\u00a0 937 F. Supp. 2d 1237 (2013).\n\u00a0 Plaintiff failed to exhaust administrative remedies with respect to certain events to the extent plaintiff sought relief in connection with the events and presented the court with no applicable law that excused exhaustion on the basis of futility. 937 F. Supp. 2d 1237 (2013).\n\u00a0 Plaintiff submitted no evidence that raised a question of fact regarding whether defendant former employer or former supervisor thought plaintiff had a mental impairment.\u00a0 937 F. Supp. 2d 1237 (2013).\n\u00a0 Summary judgment granted to defendants on plaintiff's disparate impact claims based on race, ancestry, and age, where, among other things, plaintiff did not provide evidence that allowed the court to draw even the inference that the former supervisor's criticism flowed from some discriminatory animus on the former supervisor's part.\u00a0 937 F. Supp. 2d 1237 (2013).\n\u00a0 Evidence regarding claims of disparate treatment based on age was direct; the alleged comment by the chief investigator regarding plaintiff's age not only reflected a negative attitude toward older workers, it indicated an intent to fill plaintiff's former supervisory position with a younger person because plaintiff was simply \"too old\"; summary judgment in favor of defendant denied.\u00a0 938 F. Supp. 2d 1000 (2013).\n\u00a0 Summary judgment granted to defendant regarding: (1) any \"hostile work environment\" claims plaintiff may have been trying to assert, as plaintiff provided no evidence establishing that plaintiff's workplace was permeated with discriminatory intimidation relating to plaintiff's national origin or age; and (2) plaintiff's retaliation claims, as plaintiff failed to show evidence that plaintiff engaged in protected activity, was thereafter subjected to an adverse employment action, and that there was a causal link between the protected activity and the adverse employment action.\u00a0 938 F. Supp. 2d 1000 (2013).\n\u00a0 Treating plaintiff's evidence relating to national origin discrimination, i.e., the alleged comment by the chief investigator and/or administrator reportedly referring to a need \"to make the office safe\" from plaintiff because plaintiff was \"a typical Samoan\", as \"specific\" and \"substantial\", plaintiff raised questions of fact as to plaintiff's claims of disparate treatment based on national origin in violation of this section and Title VII.\u00a0 938 F. Supp. 2d 1000 (2013).\n\u00a0 Plaintiff presented no evidence regarding adverse employment actions taken against any other employee of defendant, much less any employee who could fall within the protected class for an age discrimination claim, regarding plaintiff's age discrimination claims based upon theories of disparate impact or \"pattern-or-practice\".\u00a0 963 F. Supp. 2d 1002 (2013).\n\u00a0 Employee's motion for summary judgment denied, where plaintiff claimed disparate treatment in violation of the age discrimination provision in this section; among other things, (1) there was sufficient evidence from which a fact-finder could conclude that plaintiff's demotion was not voluntary; (2) the combination of plaintiff's supervisor's alleged statements of animus and the allegedly better treatment of a co-worker constituted sufficient evidence to meet the minimal burden required to defeat summary judgment; there was at least a question of fact as to whether age-based discrimination was the \"but for\" cause of plaintiff's demotion; and (3) drawing all reasonable inferences in plaintiff's favor, the court could not determine that the \"same actor\" inference applied.\u00a0 979 F. Supp. 2d 1069 (2013).\n\u00a0 Employer's motion for summary judgment granted as to plaintiff's hostile work environment claims, where plaintiff failed to meet plaintiff's burden of showing that there was a triable issue as to whether the work environment was permeated with discriminatory intimidation.\u00a0 Among other things, while plaintiff detailed several instances in which plaintiff was allegedly harassed or mistreated by plaintiff's supervisor, plaintiff did not provide evidence from which a jury could tell that these were incidents of \"discriminatory intimidation\" rather than just bad treatment.\u00a0 979 F. Supp. 2d 1069 (2013).\n\u00a0 Defendant employer was entitled to summary judgment as to plaintiff's discrimination claims based on race, where, among other things, plaintiff did not allege any facts linking supervisor's conduct to race-based animus, and plaintiff identified only sporadic or unquantified incidents over a three-year period of alleged racial harassment by other employees.\u00a0 979 F. Supp. 2d 1083 (2013).\n\u00a0 Defendant employer was not entitled to summary judgment on plaintiff's disability discrimination claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act and this section, where a reasonable jury could find that plaintiff's back and shoulder injuries substantially limited plaintiff's ability to stand, and there were genuine issues of fact as to whether plaintiff was a qualified individual (e.g., plaintiff's evidence raised a triable issue of fact as to whether standing and rarely sitting was an essential function of the armed security guard position, defendant never engaged in any interactive process, and the record established that an accommodation was reasonable and available).\u00a0 979 F. Supp. 2d 1083 (2013).\n\u00a0 Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration regarding plaintiff's retaliation claims under Title VII, Age Discrimination in Employment Act, and this section denied; although statements indicated that there may be causation between plaintiff's termination and an internal problems letter, the complaints in the internal problems letter about another in-house salesperson's alleged attempts to manipulate managers and the managers' alleged favoritism did not concern a protected trait; thus, plaintiff's submission of the letter and plaintiff's related complaints did not constitute a protected activity under this section.\u00a0 988 F. Supp. 2d 1184 (2013).\n\u00a0 Defendant's application of the \"Staffing Policy SH-2\" to plaintiff and plaintiff's husband in 2011 and defendant's finding a violation of the policy raised a genuine issue of material fact whether they constituted circumstantial evidence that the policy was applied in a discriminatory manner.\u00a0 19 F. Supp. 3d 1012 (2014).\n\u00a0 Defendant's \"Staffing Policy SH-2\" as applied to plaintiff violated the plain language and purpose of this section, unless the termination or other adverse action fell within one of the exceptions in \u00a7378-3.\u00a0 Because there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether an exception in \u00a7378-3 applied, the court denied defendant's motion for summary judgment with respect to plaintiff's marital status discrimination claim.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 19 F.
