[L 1987, c 267, pt of \u00a71; am L 2002, c 56, \u00a72]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Employee's wrongful termination action under Hawaii whistleblower's act preempted by ERISA whistleblower provision.\u00a0 999 F.2d 408 (1993).\n\u00a0 Because plaintiff did not have full and fair opportunity to litigate claims sounding in wrongful discharge in plaintiff's unemployment compensation benefits proceeding, the court refused to apply either issue preclusion or claim preclusion.\u00a0 866 F. Supp. 459 (1994).\n\u00a0 Because \u00a7378-2 and this section did not contain limitation periods, court invoked State's general personal injury statute of limitations, \u00a7657-7; plaintiff's state law claims barred where neither the collective bargaining proceedings nor the equal employment opportunity commission proceedings tolled the statute of limitations.\u00a0 874 F. Supp. 1095 (1994).\n\u00a0 Plaintiff's state whistleblower claim under this section barred, where plaintiff did not file complaint until well after the ninety-day period after the most recent alleged violation of the whistleblowers' protection act.\u00a0 75 F. Supp. 2d 1113 (1999).\n\u00a0 Count of complaint alleging that plaintiff was wrongfully discharged in violation of 31 U.S.C. \u00a73730(h) of the False Claims Act was time-barred, where the court found that the Hawaii Whistleblowers' Protection Act provided the state cause of action most closely analogous to a 31 U.S.C. \u00a73730(h) claim for retaliatory discharge, and thus applied a ninety-day statute of limitations to plaintiff's claim for retaliatory discharge.\u00a0 362 F. Supp. 2d 1203 (2005).\n\u00a0 Questions of material fact existed as to plaintiff's claim of retaliation in violation of the Hawaii Whistleblowers' Protection Act; the court found the fact that the adverse actions described occurred during the ongoing resolution of plaintiff's complaint sufficient to infer a causal connection between the two activities.\u00a0 410 F. Supp. 2d 939 (2005).\n\u00a0 Plaintiff failed to establish any issue of material fact as to whether plaintiff engaged in protected conduct by requesting compensation documentation or whether the conduct was a substantial motivating factor in defendants' retaliatory actions.\u00a0 490 F. Supp. 2d 1062 (2007).\n\u00a0 Defendant's motion for summary judgment as to plaintiffs' claim for violation of the Hawaii Whistleblowers' Protection Act denied, where issues of material fact existed as to defendant's motivation for removing and terminating plaintiffs; the government contractor defense did not apply in the case.\u00a0 654 F. Supp. 2d 1122 (2008).\n\u00a0 Regardless of whether plaintiff did or did not need to exhaust plaintiff's Whistleblowers' Protection Act claim, plaintiff's claim failed on the merits; plaintiff failed to demonstrate any causal connection between any action plaintiff took that plaintiff said was protected, and any conduct by plaintiff's employer that plaintiff might identify as retaliatory.\u00a0 937 F. Supp. 2d 1237 (2013).\n\u00a0 Whether exhaustion of administrative remedies was required for a Whistleblowers' Protection Act claim, discussed.\u00a0 Plaintiff's claim failed without regard to any exhaustion requirement, where plaintiff took more than two years after the date of the last adverse action that plaintiff identified as relevant to the lawsuit to file suit.\u00a0 938 F. Supp. 2d 1000 (2013).\n\u00a0 Plaintiff failed to identify an adverse employment action, where plaintiff's employment was not terminated so it could not be construed as an adverse employment action and a notation in plaintiff's file was not an adverse employment action.\u00a0 945 F. Supp. 2d 1133 (2013).\n\u00a0 Plaintiff's actions, which allegedly caused defendant's retaliation, were attenuated from the claimed retaliation in the amended complaint; among other things, no causal connection existed between plaintiff's April 2007 threat to report defendant's use of false promotional material and plaintiff's 2009 claims.\u00a0 945 F. Supp. 2d 1133 (2013)."
