[L 1981, c 94, pt of \u00a72; am L 1989, c 386, \u00a79]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Subsection (f) (1985) plainly limited available relief to appropriate equitable remedies; it did not authorize recovery of either compensatory or punitive damages, both of which were traditional legal remedies.\u00a0 76 H. 454, 879 P.2d 1037 (1994).\n\u00a0 Chapter 386 does not bar relief on claims filed with the commission.\u00a0 85 H. 7, 936 P.2d 643 (1997).\n\u00a0 Section 368-17 permits a court to award compensatory and punitive damages in civil actions brought under part I of this chapter.\u00a0 85 H. 7, 936 P.2d 643 (1997).\n\u00a0 Satisfaction of judgment did not bar plaintiff's claim for attorney's fees under this section.\u00a0 87 H. 86, 952 P.2d 374 (1997).\n\u00a0 Unemployment benefits should not be deducted from awards of back pay under Hawaii\u0092s employment discrimination law; thus, trial court did not have discretion to reduce back pay award by the amount of unemployment benefits received by employee.\u00a0 89 H. 269, 971 P.2d 1104 (1999).\n\u00a0 Hawaii courts should be given discretion to enhance the lodestar fee when an attorney has been retained on a contingency fee basis; a \"reasonable fee\" under Hawaii fee-shifting statutes is an amount of fees that \"would attract competent counsel,\" in light of all the circumstances, and that under certain circumstances the lodestar fee may be multiplied by a factor to achieve a \"reasonable\" award of fees.\u00a0 96 H. 408, 32 P.3d 52 (2001).\n\u00a0 Where a court awards attorney's fees pursuant to fee-shifting statutes in cases involving contingency fee arrangements, a trial judge should not be limited by the contingency fee arrangement between a plaintiff and his or her counsel in determining a reasonable fee; plaintiff is thus not necessarily barred from recovery of a doubled lodestar fee.\u00a0 96 H. 408, 32 P.3d 52 (2001).\n\u00a0 Where appellate court's judgment only permitted plaintiff to retry plaintiff's case, plaintiff had not established that discrimination had occurred, and plaintiff was legally in the same position as before trial, plaintiff had not been awarded a \"judgment\" within the meaning of subsection (c) and was thus not entitled to fees under this section.\u00a0 99 H. 262, 54 P.3d 433 (2002)."
