[L 1987, c 267, pt of \u00a71; am L 2002, c 56, \u00a73]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0Plaintiff's state whistleblower claim under \u00a7378-62 barred, where plaintiff did not file complaint until well after the ninety-day period after the most recent alleged violation of the whistleblowers' protection act.\u00a0 75 F. Supp. 2d 1113 (1999).\n\u00a0 Count of complaint alleging that plaintiff was wrongfully discharged in violation of 31 U.S.C. \u00a73730(h) of the False Claims Act was time-barred, where the court found that the Hawaii Whistleblowers' Protection Act provided the state cause of action most closely analogous to a 31 U.S.C. \u00a73730(h) claim for retaliatory discharge, and thus applied a ninety-day statute of limitations to plaintiff's claim for retaliatory discharge.\u00a0 362 F. Supp. 2d 1203 (2005).\n\u00a0 Plaintiff's Whistleblowers' Protection Act claim was time-barred, where plaintiff took more than two years after the date of the last adverse action that plaintiff identified as relevant to the lawsuit to file suit.\u00a0 938 F. Supp. 2d 1000 (2013)."
