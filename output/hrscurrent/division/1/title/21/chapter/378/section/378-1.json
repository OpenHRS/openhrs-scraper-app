Supp. 2d 1225 (2005).\n\u00a0 The Hawaii supreme court in French did not demonstrate a clear attempt to keep Hawaii law distinct from the federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) such that a claim under the Hawaii discrimination law raises issues sufficiently distinct from an ADA claim so as to prevent application of the first-to-file-rule.\u00a0 728 F. Supp. 2d 1096 (2010).\n\u00a0 Based on the definition of \"employer\" in this section, legislature intended all employers, regardless of size, to be subject to the provisions of this chapter.\u00a0 89 H. 269, 971 P.2d 1104 (1999).\n\u00a0 The issue of whether a plaintiff's major life activity is substantially limited must be resolved on a case-by-case basis; thus, the determination of whether the lifting restriction on employee was substantial required an individualized inquiry that was inappropriate for summary judgment.\u00a0 105 H. 462, 99 P.3d 1046 (2004)."
