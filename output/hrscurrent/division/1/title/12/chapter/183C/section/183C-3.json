[L 1994, c 270, pt of \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Section 13-5-23(L-6), Hawaii Administrative Rules, allowing for construction of single family residences within floodplains and coastal high hazard areas when granted permit approval from the board of land and natural resources, was not facially unconstitutional under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution because it was rationally related to the State's legitimate interests.\u00a0 438 F. Supp. 2d 1186.\n\u00a0 The board of land and natural resources was not required to engage in rule-making to adopt a standardized methodology for valuation of damages to conservation lands before making a valuation of damage to land in the conservation district resulting from excessive sedimentation.\u00a0 132 H. 247, 320 P.3d 912 (2014).\n\u00a0 The intermediate court of appeals correctly determined that the board of land and natural resources had jurisdiction, pursuant to paragraph (7), to institute a proceeding to enforce land use regulations on conservation district lands in a case involving the alleged damages to state lands and natural resources due to excessive sedimentation.\u00a0 132 H. 247, 320 P.3d 912 (2014)."
