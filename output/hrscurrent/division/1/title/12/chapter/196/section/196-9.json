and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (7)\u00a0 Procure environmentally preferable products, including recycled and recycled-content, bio-based, and other resource-efficient products and materials.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (c)\u00a0 With regard to motor vehicles and transportation fuel, each agency shall:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 Comply with Title 10, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 490, Subpart C, \"Mandatory State Fleet Program\", if applicable;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 Comply with all applicable state laws regarding vehicle purchases;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (3)\u00a0 Once federal and state vehicle purchase mandates have been satisfied, purchase the most fuel-efficient vehicles that meet the needs of their programs; provided that life cycle cost-benefit analysis of vehicle purchases shall include projected fuel costs;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (4)\u00a0 Purchase alternative fuels and ethanol blended gasoline when available;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (5)\u00a0 Evaluate a purchase preference for biodiesel blends, as applicable to agencies with diesel fuel purchases;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (6)\u00a0 Promote efficient operation of vehicles;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (7)\u00a0 Use the most appropriate minimum octane fuel; provided that vehicles shall use 87-octane fuel unless the owner's manual for the vehicle states otherwise or the engine experiences knocking or pinging;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (8)\u00a0 Beginning with fiscal year 2005-2006 as the baseline, collect and maintain, for the life of each vehicle acquired, the following data:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (A)\u00a0 Vehicle acquisition cost;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (B)\u00a0 United States Environmental Protection Agency rated fuel economy;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (C)\u00a0 Vehicle fuel configuration, such as gasoline, diesel, flex-fuel gasoline/E85, and dedicated propane;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (D)\u00a0 Actual in-use vehicle mileage;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (E)\u00a0 Actual in-use vehicle fuel consumption;
