[L 1985, c 138, \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nCross References\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Royalty to counties, see \u00a7182-7(c).\n\u00a0\nAttorney General Opinions\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Allocating royalties from geothermal developments on department of Hawaiian home lands (DHHL) lands to the board of land and natural resources or the counties violated \u00a74 of the Admission Act and article XII, \u00a7\u00a71 and 3 of the Hawaii constitution.\u00a0 It is clear from the Admission Act and the Hawaii constitution that the State has an obligation to manage such resources on Hawaiian home lands for the benefit of native Hawaiians pursuant to the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act (HHCA).\u00a0 Allocation of royalties from geothermal developments on DHHL lands to entities other than DHHL would be violations of both the Admission Act and the Hawaii constitution because those proceeds would not be available to DHHL to carry out the terms and conditions of the HHCA.\u00a0 Att. Gen. Op. 14-1."
