or\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (5)\u00a0 Violate the terms of, or fail to fulfill the obligations imposed and agreed to under, any license issued under subsection (f), (g), or (j) any habitat conservation plan authorized under section 195D-21, or any safe harbor agreement authorized under section 195D-22.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (f)\u00a0 The department may issue temporary licenses, under such terms and conditions as it may prescribe, to allow any act otherwise prohibited by subsection (e), for scientific purposes or to enhance the propagation or survival of the affected species.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (g)\u00a0 After consultation with the endangered species recovery committee, the board may issue a temporary license as a part of a habitat conservation plan to allow a take otherwise prohibited by subsection (e) if the take is incidental to, and not the purpose of, the carrying out of an otherwise lawful activity; provided that:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 The applicant, to the maximum extent practicable, shall minimize and mitigate the impacts of the take;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 The applicant shall guarantee that adequate funding for the plan will be provided;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (3)\u00a0 The applicant shall post a bond, provide an irrevocable letter of credit, insurance, or surety bond, or provide other similar financial tools, including depositing a sum of money in the endangered species trust fund created by section 195D-31, or provide other means approved by the board, adequate to ensure monitoring of the species by the State and to ensure that the applicant takes all actions necessary to minimize and mitigate the impacts of the take;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (4)\u00a0 The plan shall increase the likelihood that the species will survive and recover;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (5)\u00a0 The plan takes into consideration the full range of the species on the island so that cumulative impacts associated with the take can be adequately assessed;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (6)\u00a0 The measures, if any, required under section 195D-21(b) shall be met, and the department has received any other assurances that may be required so that the plan may be implemented;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (7)\u00a0 The activity, which is permitted and facilitated by issuing the license to take a species, does not involve the use of submerged lands, mining, or blasting;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (8)\u00a0 The cumulative impact of the activity, which is permitted and facilitated by the license, provides net environmental benefits; and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (9)\u00a0 The take is not likely to cause the loss of genetic representation of an affected population of any endangered, threatened, proposed, or candidate plant species.\nBoard approval shall require an affirmative vote of not less than two-thirds of the authorized membership of the board after holding a public hearing on the matter on the affected island.\u00a0 The department shall notify the public of a proposed license under this section through publication in the periodic bulletin of the office of environmental quality control and make the application and proposed license available for public review and comment for not less than sixty days prior to approval.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (h)\u00a0 Licenses issued pursuant to this section may be suspended or revoked for due cause, and if issued pursuant to a habitat conservation plan or safe harbor agreement, shall run with the land for the term agreed to in the plan or agreement and shall not be assignable or transferable separate from the land.\u00a0 Any person whose license has been revoked shall not be eligible to apply for another license until the expiration of two years from the date of revocation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (i)\u00a0 The department shall work cooperatively with federal agencies in concurrently processing habitat conservation plans, safe harbor agreements, and incidental take licenses pursuant to the Endangered Species Act.\u00a0 After notice in the periodic bulletin of the office of environmental quality control and a public hearing on the islands affected, which shall be held jointly with the federal agency, if feasible, whenever a landowner seeks both a federal and a state safe harbor agreement, habitat conservation plan, or incidental take license, the board, by a two-thirds majority vote, may approve the federal agreement, plan, or license without requiring a separate state agreement, plan, or license if the federal agreement, plan, or license satisfies, or is amended to satisfy, all the criteria of this chapter.\u00a0 All state agencies, to the extent feasible, shall work cooperatively to process applications for habitat conservation plans and safe harbor agreements on a consolidated basis including concurrent processing of any state land use permit application that may be required pursuant to chapter 183C or 205, so as to minimize procedural burdens upon the applicant.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (j)\u00a0 Subsection (e) and any other provision of law to the contrary notwithstanding, the department shall adopt rules in accordance with chapter 91 authorizing the propagation, possession, ownership, and sale of selected endangered and threatened land plant species grown from cultivated nursery stock and not collected or removed from the wild.
