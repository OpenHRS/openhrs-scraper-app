[L 1987, c 45, pt of \u00a72]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Commission did not err in regulating the Waiahole Ditch infrastructure as a unified system as independent designation of water management areas does not preclude consolidated regulation where a water delivery system draws water from several different water management areas and the consolidated regulation of a single diversion works comports entirely with the commission's function of comprehensive water planning and management.\u00a0 94 H. 97, 9 P.3d 409.\n\u00a0 Given the undisputed direct interrelationship between the surface and ground waters in the Waiahole Ditch case, the designation of Windward Oahu as a ground water management area subjects both ground and surface water diversions from the designated area to the statutory permit requirement.\u00a0 94 H. 97, 9 P.3d 409."
