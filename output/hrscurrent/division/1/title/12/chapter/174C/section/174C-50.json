provided that the commission may make such a determination without a hearing, if the quantity of water applied for does not exceed an amount per month established by rule or if the quantity of water applied for exceeds an amount per month established by rule, but no objection to the application is filed by any person having standing to file an objection.\u00a0 In determining whether an application does not exceed the amount per month established by rule, the commission shall consider an average of water use over the three-month period immediately preceding the filing of the application.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (c)\u00a0 An application for a permit to continue an existing use must be made within a period of one year from the effective date of designation.\u00a0 Except for appurtenant rights, failure to apply within this period creates a presumption of abandonment of the use, and the user, if the user desires to revive the use, must apply for a permit under section 174C-51.\u00a0 If the commission determines that there is just cause for the failure to file, it may allow a late filing.\u00a0 However, the commission may not allow a late filing more than five years after the effective date of rules implementing this chapter.\u00a0 The commission shall send two notices, one of which shall be by registered mail, to existing users to file for an application for a permit to continue an existing use.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (d)\u00a0 An application shall be acted upon by the commission within ninety calendar days of an application not requiring a hearing, or within one hundred eighty calendar days of an application requiring a hearing.\u00a0 The time periods prescribed in this subsection shall not be deemed to run for any period in which an application is not complete in all material respects in the judgment of the commission.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (e)\u00a0 The commission shall issue an interim permit; provided that the existing use meets the conditions of subsection (b).\u00a0 The commission shall also issue an interim permit for an estimated, initial allocation of water if the quantity of water consumed under the existing use is not immediately verifiable, but the existing use otherwise meets the conditions of subsection (b) for a permit or an interim permit.\u00a0 An interim permit is valid for such time period specified therein.\u00a0 The commission may issue successive interim permits of limited duration.\u00a0 Interim permits are subject to revocation under section 174C-58.\u00a0 Whenever interim permits are to be issued, the time periods specified in subsection (d) apply to the issuance or nonissuance of interim permits.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (f)\u00a0 A permit to continue an existing use shall be for a quantity of water not exceeding that quantity being consumed under the existing use.\u00a0 The quantity being consumed shall be determined and verified by the best available means not unduly burdensome on the applicant, as determined by the commission.\u00a0 The commission may prescribe the installation of metering or gauging devices, and, if so prescribed, such metering or gauging devices shall be in place and operational for at least one year before a determination is made as to the quantity of water being consumed in an existing use and a final permit is issued.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (g)\u00a0 If an interim permit is issued pending verification of the actual quantity of water being consumed under the existing use, a final determination of that quantity shall be made within five years of the filing of the application to continue the existing use.\u00a0 In the final determination, the commission may increase or reduce the amount initially granted the permittee.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (h)\u00a0 Two or more existing uses of water are deemed to be competing when they draw water from the same hydrologically controllable area and the aggregate quantity of water consumed by the users exceeds the appropriate sustainable yield or instream flow standards established pursuant to law for the area.\u00a0 If applications are made to continue existing uses which are competing and the uses otherwise meet the requirements of subsection (b), the commission shall hold a hearing to determine the quantity of water that may be consumed and the conditions to be imposed on each existing use.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (i)\u00a0 A permit user of water with a continuous reduced water usage shall be given priority to reobtain its permitted level of water usage over any other application; provided that the use remains the same and is reasonable and beneficial and water is available. [L 1987, c 45, pt of \u00a72; am L 1999, c 197, \u00a78; am L 2001, c 10, \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 The legislature (pre-2001 amendment) intended the term \"existing use\" to refer to uses existing on July 1, 1987, the effective date of the code.\u00a0 94 H. 97, 9 P.3d 409.\n\u00a0 Where proposed well constituted a \"new\" use, irrespective of whether a portion of the water derived therefrom would be utilized for existing purposes, commission erred in granting an \"interim\" use permit, ostensibly pursuant to \u00a7174C-49(a); this section provides for the issuance of an interim use permit only for \"existing legal uses\".\u00a0 103 H. 401, 83 P.3d 664.\n\u00a0 Despite evidence that permit applicant violated chapter 340E, neither the water code nor the public trust precluded the commission on water resource management from allocating water to applicant to supply water to domestic end users from a delivery system that may not comply with chapter 340E; as this jurisdiction separately regulates water allocation and drinking water standards, and there was no discernable legislative intent to make water use permit applications subject to compliance with chapter 340E, violations of chapter 340E were not germane to a review of the propriety of water allocation under the water code and the public trust.\u00a0 116 H. 481, 174 P.3d 320.\n\u00a0 Where, even assuming that subsequent landowner's application constituted a legitimate amendment of the timely existing use application filed by former landowner, such an amendment did not preserve subsequent landowner's existing uses where subsequent landowner was not identified as an applicant for existing uses in the application filed within the statutory one-year deadline pursuant to subsection (c); thus, commission on water resource management erred by considering subsequent landowner's untimely request for existing uses.\u00a0 116 H. 481, 174 P.3d 320."
