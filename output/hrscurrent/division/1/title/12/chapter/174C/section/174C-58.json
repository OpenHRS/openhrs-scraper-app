[L 1987, c 45, pt of \u00a72]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 The state water code both expressly and impliedly authorizes the commission to issue a water use permit that allocates water in excess of a four-year time frame; paragraph (4) is an enforcement mechanism by which the commission may suspend or revoke a water use permit upon knowledge that a permitted allocation of water, which the commission has expected to be used within a four-year time frame, has not been utilized.\u00a0 103 H. 401, 83 P.3d 664.\n\u00a0 Where it could not be said that closure of hotel and golf course would have no impact on applicant's proposed uses in light of commission on water resource management's findings and conclusions pursuant to the \"reasonable-beneficial use\" standard set forth in \u00a7174C-49 and defined in \u00a7174C-3, commission's reliance on paragraph (4), allowing applicant four years to fulfill its proposed uses before the commission may suspend or revoke a permit, was misplaced; as commission failed to consider the impact the closures may have on applicant's proposed uses when it made its proposed use allocation decision, proposed use permit vacated.\u00a0 116 H. 481, 174 P.3d 320."
