Gen. Op. 66-10.\n\u00a0 Section is limited to rules having the force and effect of law; AG Opinion 66-10 superseded.\u00a0 Att. Gen. Op. 72-5.\n\u00a0 State agency required by subsection (a)(1) to publish notice of hearing must in addition comply with publication requirements of section 92-41.\u00a0 Att. Gen. Op. 73-12.\n\u00a0 Board cannot adopt \"policy\" which would have the effect of amending a rule, without following HAPA requirements.\u00a0 Att. Gen. Op. 81-11.\n\u00a0 Notices are not required to be in the legal section of a newspaper.\u00a0 Att. Gen. Op. 89-4.\n\u00a0 Substantial changes in proposed rules made after public hearing require additional hearing where material is included on subject not covered in original notice or change was not advocated or discussed at original hearing.\u00a0 Att. Gen. Op. 91-05.\n\u00a0 For the repeal of rules, this section and \u00a792-41 did not require individual notice to all property owners potentially affected by the change in the rules but only notice by publication, and a mailing to those persons who requested advance notice of department's rulemaking proceedings.\u00a0 Att. Gen. Op. 97-4.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Where defendant did not give notice and hold public hearing pursuant to subsection (a) before issuing approval of use of wood preservative, defendant's approval, together with defendant's conditions of approval, would appear to be rulemaking.\u00a0 939 F. Supp. 746.\n\u00a0 Changes may be made in a rule between the original proposed and presented at a public hearing and as finally adopted.\u00a0 Substantial change in a rule after a public hearing may require another public hearing.\u00a0 50 H. 156, 434 P.2d 516.\n\u00a0 Notice should fairly apprise interested parties of what is being proposed so they can formulate and present rational responses to the proposal.\u00a0 64 H. 389, 642 P.2d 530.\n\u00a0 \"Substance\" of proposed rules defined.\u00a0 64 H. 389, 642 P.2d 530.\n\u00a0 Rule enabling insurance commissioner to prescribe endorsements did not give carte blanche authority to sidestep the independent requirements of chapter 91.\u00a0 67 H. 148, 682 P.2d 73.\n\u00a0 Adoption by reference of future amendments unlawful.\u00a0 67 H. 451, 691 P.2d 365.\n\u00a0 No waiver of notice and hearing requirements allowed where agency had discretion to interpret federal provisions as to required rules.\u00a0 68 H. 80, 705 P.2d 17.\n\u00a0 Inadequate notice, discussed.\u00a0 70 H. 135, 764 P.2d 1233.\n\u00a0 Department provided adequate notice under this chapter of its intent to hold public hearings on proposed amendments to its administrative rules; nothing in chapter or case law requires that notice of public hearings on proposed amendments be published only after the effective date of the statute authorizing such amendments.\u00a0 88 H. 307, 966 P.2d 619.\n\u00a0 Where city appraiser's unwritten methodology for determining imparted value fell within definition of a rule for purposes of \u00a791-1(4), city needed to follow rulemaking procedures set forth in this section prior to applying imparted value deductions toward golf course assessments.\u00a0 89 H. 381, 974 P.2d 21.\n\u00a0 The board of land and natural resources was not required to engage in rule-making to adopt a standardized methodology for valuation of damages to conservation lands before making a valuation of damage to land in the conservation district resulting from excessive sedimentation.\u00a0 132 H. 247, 320 P.3d 912 (2014).\n\u00a0 Notice of public hearing met all requirements of this section; no merit to points on appeal that court erroneously dismissed claims that proposed hearing room was too small and that separate hearings should be held on neighbor islands.\u00a0 10 H. App. 210, 863 P.2d 344.\n\u00a0 Sections 183D-22 and 183D-10.5 provided the authority for the department of land and natural resources to require payment of a fee for a hunting-related article such as a stamp; however, since game bird hunting was an activity permitted under chapter 183D, the department was required under \u00a7183D-3 to adopt a rule pursuant to this section when setting the stamp fees for hunting.\u00a0 117 H. 16 (App.), 175 P.3d 126. \n\u00a0 Since the addition of two extra hunting days to each week of the hunting season concerned \"conditions for entry into game management areas, and public hunting areas designated by the department of land and natural resources\" and \"open seasons\" for hunting, the express language of \u00a7183D-3 mandated that in order to add the two weekdays for bird hunting, the department had to amend Hawaii administrative rule 13-122-4 pursuant to chapter 91.\u00a0 117 H. 16 (App.), 175 P.3d 126.\n\u00a0 Cited:\u00a0 715 F. Supp. 2d 1115."
