[L 1961, c 103, \u00a78; Supp, \u00a76C-8; HRS \u00a791-8]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Hawaii public employment relations board was empowered to make declaratory ruling regarding whether violation of collective bargaining agreement is a prohibited practice.\u00a0 60 H. 436, 591 P.2d 113.\n\u00a0 Where an agency employee's only interest in obtaining a declaratory ruling from that agency stems from his or her work as an agency employee, that interest is insufficient to satisfy this section's standing requirements; where executive director's interest in filing the petition stemmed from the director's work as executive director, the Hawaii civil rights commission did not have jurisdiction to issue a declaratory order on the petition.\u00a0 104 H. 158, 86 P.3d 449.\n\u00a0 Orders disposing of petitions for declaratory rulings under this section are appealable to the circuit court pursuant to \u00a791-14; thus, circuit court had proper jurisdiction to review Hawaii labor relations board order.\u00a0 107 H. 178, 111 P.3d 587.\n\u00a0 As both the title and the pertinent text make clear, the declaratory ruling procedure of this section is meant to provide a means of seeking a determination of whether and in what way some statute, agency rule, or order, applies to the factual situation raised by an interested person; it was not intended to allow review of concrete agency decisions for which other means of review are available.\u00a0 114 H. 184, 159 P.3d 143.\n\u00a0 Where insurance commissioner's decision was appealable pursuant to \u00a791-14 because it was an order disposing of a petition brought pursuant to this section, and plaintiff was a \"person aggrieved\" by the commissioner's decision because it faced increased competition from allegedly improperly licensed competitors in the managed care plan contract process, and the decision held that plaintiff's competitors were in fact properly licensed to offer the services required under those contracts, plaintiff had standing to appeal the insurance commissioner's decision.\u00a0 126 H. 326, 271 P.3d 621."
