but nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent resort to other means of review, redress, relief, or trial de novo, including the right of trial by jury, provided by law. \u00a0Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter to the contrary, for the purposes of this section, the term \"person aggrieved\" shall include an agency that is a party to a contested case proceeding before that agency or another agency.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b)\u00a0 [Repeal and reenactment of subsection on July 1, 2019.\u00a0 L 2016, c 48, \u00a714.]\u00a0 Except as otherwise provided herein, proceedings for review shall be instituted in the circuit court or, if applicable, the environmental court, within thirty days after the preliminary ruling or within thirty days after service of the certified copy of the final decision and order of the agency pursuant to rule of court, except where a statute provides for a direct appeal to the supreme court or the intermediate appellate court, subject to chapter 602.\u00a0 In such cases, the appeal shall be treated in the same manner as an appeal from the circuit court to the supreme court or the intermediate appellate court, including payment of the fee prescribed by section 607-5 for filing the notice of appeal (except in cases appealed under sections 11-51 and 40-91).\u00a0 The court in its discretion may permit other interested persons to intervene.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (c)\u00a0 The proceedings for review shall not stay enforcement of the agency decisions or the confirmation of any fine as a judgment pursuant to section 92-17(g); but the reviewing court may order a stay if the following criteria have been met:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 There is likelihood that the subject person will prevail on the merits of an appeal from the administrative proceeding to the court;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 Irreparable damage to the subject person will result if a stay is not ordered;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (3)\u00a0 No irreparable damage to the public will result from the stay order; and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (4)\u00a0 Public interest will be served by the stay order.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (d)\u00a0 Within twenty days after the determination of the contents of the record on appeal in the manner provided by the rules of court, or within such further time as the court may allow, the agency shall transmit to the reviewing court the record of the proceeding under review.\u00a0 The court may require or permit subsequent corrections or additions to the record when deemed desirable.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (e)\u00a0 If, before the date set for hearing, application is made to the court for leave to present additional evidence material to the issue in the case, and it is shown to the satisfaction of the court that the additional evidence is material and that there were good reasons for failure to present it in the proceeding before the agency, the court may order that the additional evidence be taken before the agency upon such conditions as the court deems proper.\u00a0 The agency may modify its findings, decision, and order by reason of the additional evidence and shall file with the reviewing court, to become a part of the record, the additional evidence, together with any modifications or new findings or decision.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (f)\u00a0 [Repeal and reenactment of subsection on July 1, 2019.\u00a0 L 2016, c 48, \u00a714.]\u00a0 The review shall be conducted by the appropriate court without a jury and shall be confined to the record, except that in the cases where a trial de novo, including trial by jury, is provided by law and also in cases of alleged irregularities in procedure before the agency not shown in the record, testimony thereon may be taken in court.\u00a0 The court, upon request by any party, shall receive written briefs and, at the court's discretion, may hear oral arguments.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (g)\u00a0 [Repeal and reenactment of subsection on July 1, 2019.\u00a0 L 2016, c 48, \u00a714.]\u00a0 Upon review of the record, the court may affirm the decision of the agency or remand the case with instructions for further proceedings; or it may reverse or modify the decision and order if the substantial rights of the petitioners may have been prejudiced because the administrative findings, conclusions, decisions, or orders are:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 In violation of constitutional or statutory provisions;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 In excess of the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the agency;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (3)\u00a0 Made upon unlawful procedure;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (4)\u00a0 Affected by other error of law;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (5)\u00a0 Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record; or\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (6)\u00a0 Arbitrary, or capricious, or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (h)\u00a0 Upon a trial de novo, including a trial by jury as provided by law, the court shall transmit to the agency its decision and order with instructions to comply with the order.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (i)\u00a0 [Repeal of subsection on July 1, 2019.\u00a0 L 2016, c 48, \u00a714.]\u00a0 Where a court remands a matter to an agency for the purpose of conducting a contested case hearing, the court may reserve jurisdiction and appoint a master or monitor to ensure compliance with its orders.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (j)\u00a0 [Repeal of subsection on July 1, 2019.\u00a0 L 2016, c 48, \u00a714.]\u00a0 The court shall give priority to contested case appeals of significant statewide importance over all other civil or administrative appeals or matters and shall decide these appeals as expeditiously as possible.

consequently, judicial review by circuit court of commission's denial of appellants' request for a contested case hearing as well as review of commission's approval of third-party agreements was unattainable due to lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\u00a0 76 H. 128, 870 P.2d 1272.\n\u00a0 Supreme court could not conclude that board of land and natural resources' findings regarding application for conservation district use permit were clearly erroneous.\u00a0 76 H. 259, 874 P.2d 1084.\n\u00a0 Circuit court properly concluded that it was vested with appellate jurisdiction pursuant to subsection (a).\u00a0 With respect to issue of standing, certain appellees demonstrated sufficient participation and potential injury in fact to seek judicial review of agency decision; other appellees who did not sufficiently participate in contested case were precluded from seeking judicial review under subsection (a).\u00a0 77 H. 64, 881 P.2d 1210.\n\u00a0 \"Clearly erroneous\" standard applies to appeals from findings in decisions of labor and industrial relations appeals board.\u00a0 77 H. 100, 881 P.2d 1246.\n\u00a0 Appeal to circuit court of zoning board of appeals' final decision and order was timely, and circuit court properly exercised jurisdiction over the matter.\u00a0 77 H. 168, 883 P.2d 629.\n\u00a0 Supreme court lacked appellate jurisdiction where there was no final decision with respect to claimant's workers' compensation benefits for incident which labor and industrial relations appeals board determined to be compensable.\u00a0 77 H. 305, 884 P.2d 368.\n\u00a0 Circuit court's appellate jurisdiction proper where planning commission rendered its final view, appellant was involved \"in\" the contested case and sufficiently demonstrated standing to participate.\u00a0 79 H. 425, 903 P.2d 1246.\n\u00a0 A water management area designation is not the product of a contested case hearing, under this chapter, from which a direct appeal to the supreme court may be brought under \u00a7174C-60.\u00a0 83 H. 484, 927 P.2d 1367.\n\u00a0 Where director's violation of \u00a791-13 by consulting materials and individuals outside the record did not prejudice appellant's substantial rights, harmless error.\u00a0 87 H. 217, 953 P.2d 1315.\n\u00a0 Where county planning director's decision that developer's proposed action was inconsistent with community plan did not meet any of the standards for reversal under subsection (g), circuit court erred in reversing decision.\u00a0 88 H. 108, 962 P.2d 367.\n\u00a0 Where no express procedure provided in Maui charter or Maui special management area rules for appeal of Maui planning director's decision on a minor permit application to the Maui planning commission, and commission delegated authority to render final decision on minor permit applications to director pursuant to \u00a7205A-22, director's decision not to process developer's application was a final decision equivalent to a denial of the application and was thus appealable under subsection (a).\u00a0 88 H. 108, 962 P.2d 367.\n\u00a0 A decision that finally adjudicates the matter of medical and temporary disability benefits under \u00a7\u00a7386-21, 386-31(b), and 386-32(b) is an appealable final order under subsection (a), even though the matter of permanent disability benefits under \u00a7\u00a7386-31(a) and 386-32(a) has been left for later determination.\u00a0 89 H. 436, 974 P.2d 1026.\n\u00a0 Where entitlement to permanent disability or disfigurement benefits is the right of the claimant that remains undetermined and is the matter for which jurisdiction is retained by the labor director, a decision of the labor and industrial relations appeals board that otherwise finally adjudicates the matters of medical and temporary disability benefits is an appealable final order under subsection (a).\u00a0 89 H. 436, 974 P.2d 1026.\n\u00a0 Where county board of appeals at no time questioned or disclaimed planning director's action, and director could not have issued denial of appeal on director's own authority, director acted on behalf of board when director summarily rejected plaintiffs' appeals as untimely; thus, director's denial constituted a \"final decision\" by the board under subsection (a), which circuit court had jurisdiction to review on appeal.\u00a0 90 H. 384, 978 P.2d 822.\n\u00a0 Where plaintiffs' members, as native Hawaiians who exercised such rights as were customarily and traditionally exercised for subsistence, cultural, and religious purposes, sufficiently demonstrated injury to their interests for purposes of appeal under this chapter, the trial court properly concluded that plaintiff had standing to invoke judicial resolution of the land use commission's decision.\u00a0 94 H. 31, 7 P.3d 1068.\n\u00a0 Where plaintiffs sufficiently demonstrated an \"injury in fact\" by alleging facts to show that its members were recreational users of the petition area and that land use commission's action would \"diminish\" such use, and also asserted their interests in protecting West Hawaii's scenic, aesthetic, historic, and biological resources, they were \"persons aggrieved\" within the meaning of this section and trial court did not err in concluding plaintiff had standing to seek judicial review of the commission's decision.\u00a0 94 H. 31, 7 P.3d 1068.\n\u00a0 An order regarding the award or denial of attorney's fees and costs with respect to \u00a7386-93(b) is a final order under subsection (a) for purposes of appeal; this final order rule applies prospectively to prevent injustice; \u00a7386-93(b) allows assessment of attorney's fees and costs against an employer if the employer loses the final appeal.\u00a0 104 H. 164, 86 P.3d 973.\n\u00a0 A contested case hearing pursuant to subsection (a) was not required in the determination by the labor director to register an apprenticeship program pursuant to \u00a7372-4.\u00a0 104 H. 275, 88 P.3d 647.\n\u00a0 District family courts may not exercise judicial review of administrative proceedings conducted pursuant to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.\u00a0 105 H. 38, 93 P.3d 1145.\n\u00a0 The agency-specific appellate procedure prescribed in \u00a7232-17 precluded appellants' resort to judicial review under subsection (a); jurisdiction to hear appellants' tax appeal rested exclusively with the tax appeal court.\u00a0 106 H. 318, 104 P.3d 905.\n\u00a0 Orders disposing of petitions for declaratory rulings under \u00a791-8 are appealable to the circuit court pursuant to this section; thus, circuit court had proper jurisdiction to review Hawaii labor relations board order.\u00a0 107 H. 178, 111 P.3d 587.\n\u00a0 Where the purpose of the land use commission's hearing was not to determine the rights, duties, or privileges of specific parties, the hearing did not constitute a contested case for the purposes of obtaining judicial review pursuant to subsection (a), thus, the trial court did not err in dismissing plaintiff's appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\u00a0 111 H. 124, 139 P.3d 712.\n\u00a0 Where appellants failed to comply with the specific procedures promulgated by the department of land and natural resources, specifically, Hawaii administrative rule \u00a713-1-29, in requesting a contested case hearing, such failure precluded judicial review pursuant to this section.\u00a0 112 H. 28, 143 P.3d 1230.\n\u00a0 Where a public hearing pertaining to the issuance of a liquor license was statutorily required under \u00a7\u00a7281-52 and 281-57, and petitioner's legal rights, duties, and privileges were determined based on the public hearing regarding the decision to grant or deny a liquor license to petitioner, the public hearing was a \"contested case\" hearing governed by chapter 91; thus, (1) petitioner was entitled to judicial review under this section, (2) \u00a791-11 applied to proceedings on petitioner's application for liquor license, and (3) the liquor commission did not comply with \u00a791-11.\u00a0 118 H. 320, 189 P.3d 432.\n\u00a0\u00a0Section 6E-43 and \u00a713-300-51, Hawaii administrative rules (HAR) confer upon an aggrieved claimant the right to a contested case hearing as long as the written petition meets the procedural requirements of \u00a713-300-52, HAR; where it was undisputed that claimant complied with the requirements of \u00a713-300-52, HAR--that is, claimant's written petition was proper--a contested case hearing was mandated by statute under \u00a76E-43 and agency rule under \u00a713-300-51, HAR and thus, was \"required by law\".\u00a0 124 H. 1, 237 P.3d 1067.\n\u00a0 Where a contested case hearing was required by law under \u00a76E-43 and \u00a713-300-51, Hawaii administrative rules, and would have determined the rights, duties, and privileges of specific parties, and: (1) the department of land and natural resources' denial of claimant's request for a contested case hearing represented a \"final decision and order\"; (2) claimant followed the applicable agency rules and, therefore, was involved \"in\" the contested case; and (3) claimant's legal interests were injured--i.e., claimant had standing to appeal, the circuit court erred in dismissing claimant's agency appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\u00a0 124 H. 1, 237 P.3d 1067.\n\u00a0 Where insurance commissioner's decision was appealable pursuant to this section because it was an order disposing of a petition brought pursuant to \u00a791-8, and plaintiff was a \"person aggrieved\" by the commissioner's decision because it faced increased competition from allegedly improperly licensed competitors in the managed care plan contract process, and the decision held that plaintiff's competitors were in fact properly licensed to offer the services required under those contracts, plaintiff had standing to appeal the insurance commissioner's decision.\u00a0 126 H. 326, 271 P.3d 621.\n\u00a0 Because the university's conservation district use permit remained in effect despite the board of land and natural resources' failure to hold a contested case hearing before voting to grant the permit, the university could still build on Haleakala and petitioner could still seek effective relief against the university; thus, the case was not moot.\u00a0 131 H. 193, 317 P.3d 300 (2013).\n\u00a0 Where petitioner met all of the requirements of the PASH/Kaleikini test, the board of land and natural resources should have held a contested case hearing, as required by law and requested by petitioner, prior to decision making on the university's conservation district use application, and the circuit court had jurisdiction to hear petitioner's agency appeal under this section.\u00a0 131 H. 193, 317 P.3d 300 (2013).\n\u00a0 Court's findings of fact reviewed under the \"clearly erroneous\" standard and its conclusions of law under the de novo standard, without any particularized presumption of validity or need to consider whether the board of land and natural resources' decision was \"unjust and unreasonable\".\u00a0 132 H. 9, 319 P.3d 1017 (2014).\n\u00a0 The board of land and natural resources' amended decision reflected an abuse of discretion because it arbitrarily and capriciously failed to follow the instructions of the court on remand from its earlier decision.\u00a0 132 H. 9, 319 P.3d 1017 (2014).\n\u00a0 The disability compensation division of the department of labor and industrial relations must set forth its reasons for reducing an attorney's fee request for appropriate appeals board and possible judicial review of the reduction pursuant to this section; the format of an order reducing attorney's fees and/or costs need only be sufficient to enable appropriate review for abuse of discretion.\u00a0 132 H. 320, 321 P.3d 671 (2014).\n\u00a0 Cited in reviewing decision of the labor and industrial relations appeal board.\u00a0 1 H.

App. 198, 828 P.2d. 1284.\n\u00a0 Review of agency decision confined to issues properly raised in record of proceedings leading up to decision.\u00a0 5 H. App. 115, 678 P.2d 1101.\n\u00a0 Public employers directly affected by agency's order were \"aggrieved persons\" and their filing of amicus briefs with agency was sufficient \"adversary participation\"; standard used by appellate court when reviewing circuit court's review of agency decision.\u00a0 5 H. App. 533, 704 P.2d 917.\n\u00a0 Does not require that all evidence before agency support its findings; sufficient if findings supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence.\u00a0 6 H. App. 540, 735 P.2d 950.\n\u00a0 No \"contested case\" occurred even though there are situations where a public hearing may be considered a contested case because department rules established procedures for contested cases.\u00a0 8 H. App. 16, 791 P.2d 1267.\n\u00a0 Service of certified copy of agency decision under this section is complete when certified copy is deposited in the mail.\u00a0 9 H. App. 298, 837 P.2d 311.\n\u00a0 County of Hawai`i department of finance was an \"agency\" within the meaning of chapter 91, and was not a \"person\" entitled to appeal under this section (prior to 1993 amendment).\u00a0 77 H. 396 (App.), 885 P.2d 1137.\n\u00a0 Because appellant did not demonstrate that it suffered concrete injury, it was not a person \"aggrieved\" by HLRB decision; thus, it did not have standing to appeal decision to circuit court.\u00a0 80 H. 376 (App.), 910 P.2d 147.\n\u00a0 Although not titled \"Notice of Appeal\", where document fairly communicated appellants' intent to appeal appeals administrator's decision and record contained no indication that the document misled or prejudiced department in any way, circuit court had jurisdiction over appellants' appeal.\u00a0 98 H. 80 (App.), 42 P.3d 657.\n\u00a0 Appellants were not entitled to be compensated for their costs in defending against department's efforts to recoup benefits allegedly overpaid to them as pursuant to subsection (g), there is no authority vested in the hearing officer, the circuit court, or the appellate court to award damages to appellants for these costs.\u00a0 98 H. 80 (App.), 42 P.3d 657.\n\u00a0 Where lessee failed to timely appeal Hawaiian homes commission's decision to cancel lease, as required under this section, commission was left without jurisdiction to act on lessee's subsequent requests for reconsideration.\u00a0 106 H. 246 (App.), 103 P.3d 406.\n\u00a0 Hawaii labor relations board (HLRB) order was not a \"final order\" within the meaning of subsection (a) where, in the order, the HLRB set an evidentiary hearing \"to determine whether there had been bad faith during negotiations, and if there had been repudiation of the collective bargaining agreement, whether any repudiation was willful\"; thus, as the matter was retained for further action and the rights of the parties remained undetermined because the evidentiary hearing had yet to be held, circuit court did not err in dismissing appeal when it determined that it did not have jurisdiction because the order was not a final order.\u00a0 126 H. 13 (App.), 265 P.3d 482.\n\u00a0 Where a hearing on a petition for a declaratory order before the public utilities commission was discretionary and not required by law, the dismissal order was not a contested case under \u00a791-1(5); therefore, as a direct appeal to the intermediate appellate court (ICA) under subsection (b) and \u00a7269-15.5 only applied to contested cases, appellant power company was not entitled to appeal the dismissal order directly to the ICA; thus, the ICA lacked jurisdiction over appellant's appeal.\u00a0 126 H. 242 (App.), 269 P.3d 777.\n\u00a0 Subsection (f) does not apply in a family court's review of a department of human services' placement decision; the family court is not limited to evidence that the department considered in making its decision to determine whether or not the department's decision was in the child's best interests.\u00a0 130 H. 486 (App.), 312 P.3d 1193 (2013).\n\u00a0 Cited:\u00a0 47 H. 1, 24, 384 P.2d 536; 50 H. 172, 435 P.2d 21.\n\u00a0 Mentioned:\u00a0 904 F.
