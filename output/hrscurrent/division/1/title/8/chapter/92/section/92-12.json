Rev. 271 (2014).\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Entitles \"any person\" to \"commence a suit in the circuit court of the circuit in which a prohibited act occurs\", regardless of the person's participation in any proceeding.\u00a0 74 H. 365, 846 P.2d 882.\n\u00a0 Award of attorneys' fees under subsection (c) intended to apply where citizen prevails against government; prevailing defendant private party thus not entitled to attorneys' fees under this subsection.\u00a0 86 H. 132, 948 P.2d 122.\n\u00a0 Plaintiffs, as a \"private attorney general\", had standing pursuant to subsection (c) to present case to determine the applicability of the sunshine law to defendants' conduct--where five or more city council members participated in a series of private one-on-one conversations regarding, among other matters, the proposed reorganization of the council's standing committees--and to seek a declaration that it violated the sunshine law.\u00a0\u00a0 117 H. 1 (App.), 175 P.3d 111.\n\u00a0 Trial court did not err in hearing plaintiffs' suit as to the allegations that defendants' conduct relating to a council resolution violated the sunshine law where exceptions to the mootness doctrine applied to the case, including the public interest exception when the question involved affects the public interest and is likely that similar questions arising in the future would likewise become moot before a needed authoritative determination by an appellate court, and the exception when the case is capable of repetition, yet evades review.\u00a0 117 H. 1 (App.), 175 P.3d 111.\n\u00a0 Where plaintiffs prevailed on some, but not all, of their claims, but plaintiffs' claims for relief involved a common core of facts and were based on related legal theories, and much of counsel's time was devoted generally to litigation as a whole, making it difficult to divide the hours expended on a claim-by-claim basis, trial court should not have reduced the plaintiffs' attorney's fees request by seventy-five per cent; plaintiffs were thus entitled to full attorney's fees pursuant to subsection (c).\u00a0 117 H. 1 (App.), 175 P.3d 111.\n\u00a0 As this chapter governs board meetings and board meeting minutes, including those of executive sessions, and this section, by its plain language, permits \"any person\", including the county, to bring suit in circuit court \"to determine the applicability of part I of this chapter to the discussions or decisions\" of the council, the circuit court did not err in determining it had jurisdiction pursuant to this chapter to determine whether county council's executive session minutes had to be disclosed.\u00a0 120 H. 34 (App.), 200 P.3d 403."
