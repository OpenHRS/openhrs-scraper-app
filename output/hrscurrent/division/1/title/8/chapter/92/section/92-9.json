[L 1975, c 166, pt of \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nAttorney General Opinions\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 This section and \u00a7\u00a792-1 and 92-7 require commission to specify subject matter of items on public meeting agenda; agency responsible to make its minutes available to public.\u00a0 Att. Gen. Op. 85-2.\n\u00a0 This section and \u00a792-5(a)(2) read together permit board and commission members to disclose some matters deliberated or decided in executive session, but they cannot disclose matters which would be inconsistent with \u00a792-5(a)(2), i.e., matters affecting privacy of individuals under consideration for hire and they must maintain this confidentiality for as long as disclosure would defeat purpose of convening the executive meeting.\u00a0 Att. Gen. Op. 94-1.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 In a suit deciding whether disclosure of county council executive session minutes was required, circuit court properly found that both chapter 92F and this chapter applied; if the meeting met an exception to the open meeting requirements put forth in this chapter, such as an exception enumerated in \u00a792-5, the council was not required to disclose the minutes of that meeting to the public; if the meeting did not fall under such an exception, the council was required to disclose the minutes\u00a0 pursuant to this section and \u00a792F-12.\u00a0 120 H. 34 (App.), 200 P.3d 403."
