[L 1975, c 166, pt of \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nAttorney General Opinions\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 This section and sections 92-7 and 92-9 require commission to specify subject matter of items on public meeting agenda.\u00a0 Att. Gen. Op. 85-2.\n\u00a0 Interpretation of \"board\" as excluding county council would be inconsistent with policy and intent of sunshine law.\u00a0 Att. Gen. Op. 86-5.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Based on the office of information practice's construction of the sunshine law as well as the legislative history of \u00a792-7(d), the land use commission and Maui county council did not violate the sunshine law by continuing and reconvening meetings beyond a single continuance without requiring a new agenda and additional public testimony to be accepted at every continued meeting.\u00a0 However, while the legislature did not expressly limit the number of continuances permissible under \u00a792-7(d), the legislative history and text of the sunshine law demonstrates that boards are constrained at all times by the spirit of and purpose of the sunshine law, as stated in this section.\u00a0 130 H. 228, 307 P.3d 1174 (2013)."
