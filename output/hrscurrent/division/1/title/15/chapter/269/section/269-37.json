[L 1995, c 225, pt of \u00a72]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 The statutes and rules cited by defendants did not require dismissal of the billing disputes on the basis of primary jurisdiction.\u00a0 Sections 269-6 and 269-16 and this section did not place the action in the instant case within the \"special competence\" of the public utilities commission (PUC); the statutes provided the PUC with authority to take certain actions as an administrative agency, but the authority granted to the PUC over certain types of billing disputes is shared with the courts.\u00a0 131 H. 257, 318 P.3d 97 (2013)."
