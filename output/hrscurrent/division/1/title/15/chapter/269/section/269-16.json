provided that the commission shall require by order the public utility to return, in the form of an adjustment to rates, fares, or charges to be billed in the future, any amounts with interest, at a rate equal to the rate of return on the public utility's rate base found to be reasonable by the commission, received by reason of continued operation that are in excess of the rates, fares, or charges finally determined to be just and reasonable by the commission.\u00a0 Interest on any excess shall commence as of the date that any rate, fare, or charge goes into effect that results in the excess and shall continue to accrue on the balance of the excess until returned.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (d)\u00a0 The commission shall make every effort to complete its deliberations and issue its decision as expeditiously as possible and before nine months from the date the public utility filed its completed application;

and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (3)\u00a0 Make every effort to complete its deliberations and issue a proposed decision and order within six months from the date the public utility files a completed application with the commission; provided that all parties to the proceeding strictly comply with the procedural schedule established by the commission and no person is permitted to intervene.\u00a0 If a proposed decision and order is rendered after the six-month period, the commission shall report in writing the reasons therefor to the legislature within thirty days after rendering the proposed decision and order.\u00a0 Prior to the issuance of the commission's proposed decision and order, the parties shall not be entitled to a contested case hearing.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If all parties to the proceeding accept the proposed decision and order, the parties shall not be entitled to a contested case hearing, and section 269\u201115.5 shall not apply.\u00a0 If the commission permits a person to intervene, the six\u2011month period shall not apply and the commission shall make every effort to complete its deliberations and issue its decision within the nine\u2011month period from the date the public utility's completed application was filed, pursuant to subsections (b), (c), and (d).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If a party does not accept the proposed decision and order, either in whole or in part, that party shall give notice of its objection or nonacceptance within the timeframe prescribed by the commission in the proposed decision and order, setting forth the basis for its objection or nonacceptance; provided that the proposed decision and order shall have no force or effect pending the commission's final decision.\u00a0 If notice is filed, the above six\u2011month period shall not apply and the commission shall make every effort to complete its deliberations and issue its decision within the nine\u2011month period from the date the public utility's completed application was filed as set forth in subsection (d).\u00a0 Any party that does not accept the proposed decision and order under this paragraph shall be entitled to a contested case hearing; provided that the parties to the proceeding may waive the contested case hearing.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Public utilities subject to this subsection shall follow the standard chart of accounts to be approved by the commission for financial reporting purposes.\u00a0 The public utilities shall file a certified copy of the annual financial statements in addition to an updated chart of accounts used to maintain their financial records with the commission and consumer advocate within ninety days from the end of each calendar or fiscal year, as applicable, unless this timeframe is extended by the commission.\u00a0 The owner, officer, general partner, or authorized agent of the utility shall certify that the reports were prepared in accordance with the standard chart of accounts.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (g)\u00a0 Any automatic fuel rate adjustment clause requested by a public utility in an application filed with the commission shall be designed, as determined in the commission's discretion, to:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 Fairly share the risk of fuel cost changes between the public utility and its customers;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 Provide the public utility with sufficient incentive to reasonably manage or lower its fuel costs and encourage greater use of renewable energy;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (3)\u00a0 Allow the public utility to mitigate the risk of sudden or frequent fuel cost changes that cannot otherwise reasonably be mitigated through other commercially available means, such as through fuel hedging contracts;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (4)\u00a0 Preserve, to the extent reasonably possible, the public utility's financial integrity; and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (5)\u00a0 Minimize, to the extent reasonably possible, the public utility's need to apply for frequent applications for general rate increases to account for the changes to its fuel costs.

67 H. 370, 689 P.2d 741; 67 H. 425, 690 P.2d 274.\n\u00a0 No abuse of discretion in utilizing original cost method of valuating rate base, or in concluding that telephone company's plant-in-service was used or useful for public utility purposes.\u00a0 65 H. 293, 651 P.2d 475.\n\u00a0 Commission did not arbitrarily limit rate award.\u00a0 67 H. 370, 689 P.2d 741.\n\u00a0 Rebuttable presumption that a contribution was made by lot owners, or lessees, for construction of a utility system arises only if certain factors reveal intent by developer to obtain double recovery for its capital construction costs; commission erred in applying rebuttable presumption.\u00a0 83 H. 132, 925 P.2d 302.\n\u00a0 Under subsection (f) (1997), direct appeal to supreme court from PUC order lies only when PUC order pertains to regulation of utility rates or ratemaking procedures; supreme court thus lacked jurisdiction to hear direct appeal for PUC order pertaining to placement of transmission line.\u00a0 85 H. 322, 944 P.2d 1265.\n\u00a0 Under the filed-rate doctrine, telephone customers' claims failed as a matter of law where customers could not demonstrate that telephone company's allegedly inadequate disclosures constituted an unfair or deceptive trade practice because (1) company's tariffs on file with the public utilities commission disclosed that fees should be assessed against customers receiving touch calling services; (2) knowledge of these disclosures contained in the tariff was imputed to the customers, and, thus, (3) customers could prove neither the injury nor the likelihood of damage that is required under \u00a7480-2 or chapter 481A.\u00a0 109 H. 69, 123 P.3d 194.\n\u00a0 The statutes and rules cited by defendants did not require dismissal of the billing disputes on the basis of primary jurisdiction.\u00a0 Sections 269-6 and 269-37 and this section did not place the action in the instant case within the \"special competence\" of the public utilities commission (PUC); the statutes provided the PUC with authority to take certain actions as an administrative agency, but the authority granted to the PUC over certain types of billing disputes is shared with the courts.\u00a0 131 H. 257, 318 P.3d 97 (2013).\n\u00a0 Where (1) sewage system operator was a regulated public utility whose 2004 tariff was duly filed and approved by the commission and set the rates for all of the operator's customers; (2) the State was a sewerage customer; and (3) the application of the 2004 tariff rates to the State conflicted with the free services provision in the 1961 agreement with the State, the filed-rate doctrine prohibited the enforcement of a promised contract rate that contradicted the published tariff rate.\u00a0 125 H. 210 (App.), 257 P.3d 223 (2011).\n\u00a0 Section does not require a cost of service study; because it is not the method used in determining the rate, but rather the outcome that is dispositive, a cost of service study is not a necessary component of a rate increase proceeding; without a further showing of an unjust and unreasonable result, the lack of a cost of service study alone was not enough to show that the public utilities commission erred in approving the utility's requested rate increase.\u00a0 127 H. 234 (App.), 277 P.3d 328 (2012).\n\u00a0 Where county could not illustrate how utility's purported illegal use of the well without a proper permit or use of the irrigation system without conducting an environmental assessment generated unnecessary costs that would not have been incurred if utility had complied with the law, county failed to demonstrate how the public utilities commission's approval of a rate increase was not \"just and reasonable\".\u00a0 127 H. 234 (App.), 277 P.3d 328 (2012).\n\u00a0 In order for a charge to be considered unjust and unreasonable, the charge must be based on expenses unnecessarily incurred as the result of illegal activity; where county failed to demonstrate how the lack of a certificate of public convenience and necessity for the Kualapuu area resulted in unnecessary expenses that would not have occurred had water utility services company complied with the law by having the certificate, county failed to demonstrate how the rate approved by the public utilities commission was unjust and unreasonable.\u00a0 127 H. 404 (App.), 279 P.3d 69 (2012).\n\u00a0 The language of this section grants to the public utilities commission broad discretionary power in the area of rate regulation, provided that the rates set are just and reasonable; as the standard for allowing attorney's fees to be passed on to the consumer in a rate case proceeding differs from the standard used in civil cases where there is a need to distinguish between types of fees, the commission correctly held that all reasonable rate case activities were reimbursable under regulatory expense; the commission thus did not err in approving $225,000 in total regulatory expenses, including non-itemized attorneys' bills.\u00a0 127 H. 404 (App.), 279 P.3d 69 (2012)."
