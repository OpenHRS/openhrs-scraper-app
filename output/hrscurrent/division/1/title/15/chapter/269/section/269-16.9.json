and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (12)\u00a0 The potential for the exercise of substantial market power by the exempt provider or by a provider of the exempt telecommunications service.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b)\u00a0 The commission shall expedite, where practicable, the regulatory process with respect to exemptions and shall adopt guidelines under which each provider of an exempted service shall be subject to similar terms and conditions.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (c)\u00a0 The commission may condition or limit any exemption as the commission deems necessary in the public interest.\u00a0 The commission may provide a trial period for any exemption and may terminate the exemption or continue it for such period and under such conditions and limitations as it deems appropriate.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (d)\u00a0 The commission may require a telecommunications provider to apply for a certificate of public convenience and necessity pursuant to section 269-7.5; provided that the commission may waive any application requirement whenever it deems the waiver to be in furtherance of the purposes of this section.\u00a0 The exemptions under this section may be granted in a proceeding for certification or in a separate proceeding.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (e)\u00a0 The commission may waive other regulatory requirements under this chapter applicable to telecommunications providers when it determines that competition will serve the same purpose as public interest regulation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (f)\u00a0 If any provider of an exempt telecommunications service or any exempt telecommunications provider elects to terminate its service, it shall provide notice of this to its customers, the commission, and every telephone public utility providing basic local exchange service in this State.\u00a0 The notice shall be in writing and given not less than six months before the intended termination date.\u00a0 Upon termination of service by a provider of an exempt service or by an exempt provider, the appropriate telephone public utility providing basic local exchange service shall ensure that all customers affected by the termination receive basic local exchange service.\u00a0 The commission shall, upon notice and hearing or by rule, determine the party or parties who shall bear the cost, if any, of access to the basic local exchange service by the customers of the terminated exempt service.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (g)\u00a0 Upon the petition of any person or upon its own motion, the commission may rescind any exemption or waiver granted under this section if, after notice and hearing, it finds that the conditions prompting the granting of the exemption or waiver no longer apply, or that the exemption or waiver is no longer in the public interest, or that the telecommunications provider has failed to comply with one or more of the conditions of the exemption or applicable statutory or regulatory requirements.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (h)\u00a0 For purposes of this section, the commission, upon determination that any area of the State has less than adequate telecommunications service, shall require the existing telecommunications provider to show cause as to why the commission should not authorize an alternative telecommunications provider for that area under the terms and conditions of this section.
