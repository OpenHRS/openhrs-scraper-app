State;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (3)\u00a0 No further authorization of the legislature shall be required for the issuance of the special facility revenue bonds, but the approval of the governor shall

within or without the State to serve as trustee for the holders of the revenue bonds and may enter into a trust indenture or trust agreement with the trustee.\u00a0 The trustee may be authorized by the department to collect, hold, and administer the revenues derived from the special facility for which the revenue bonds are issued and to apply the revenues to the payment of the principal and interest on the revenue bonds.\u00a0 In the event that any trustee shall be appointed, any trust indenture or agreement entered into by the department with the trustee may contain the covenants and provisions authorized by part III of chapter 39 to be inserted in a resolution adopted or certificate issued, as though the words \"resolution\" or \"certificate\" as used in that part read \"trust indenture or agreement\".\u00a0 The covenants and provisions shall not be required to be included in the resolution or certificate authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds if included in the

the payment of the principal and interest, and for the purchase, registration, transfer, exchange, and redemption, of the revenue bonds, or may elect to limit the functions the director of finance shall perform as the fiscal agent.\u00a0 The department with the approval of the director of finance may appoint the trustee to serve as the fiscal agent, and may authorize and empower the trustee to perform the functions with respect to payment, purchase, registration, transfer, exchange, and redemption, that the department may deem necessary, advisable, or expedient, including, without limitation, the holding of the revenue bonds and coupons which have been paid and the supervision and conduction of the destruction thereof in accordance with sections 40-10 and 40-11.\u00a0 Nothing in this paragraph shall be a limitation upon or construed as a limitation upon the powers granted in the preceding paragraph to the department with the approval of the director of finance to appoint the trustee, or granted in sections 36-3 and 39-13 and the third sentence of section 39-68 to the director of finance to appoint the trustee or others, as fiscal agents, paying agents, and registrars for the revenue bonds or to authorize and empower the fiscal agents, paying agents, and registrars to perform the functions referred to in that paragraph and sections, it being the intent of this paragraph to confirm that the director of finance as aforesaid may elect not to serve as fiscal agent for the revenue bonds or may elect to limit the functions the director of finance shall perform as the fiscal agent, that the director of finance may deem necessary, advisable, or expedient;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (8)\u00a0 The department may sell the revenue bonds either at public or private sale;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (9)\u00a0 If no trustee shall be appointed to collect, hold, and administer the revenues derived from the special facility for which the revenue bonds are issued, the revenues shall be held in a separate account in the treasury of the State, separate and apart from the airport revenue fund, to be applied solely to the carrying out of the resolution, certificate, trust indenture, or trust agreement authorizing or securing the revenue bonds;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (10)\u00a0 If the resolution, certificate, trust indenture, or trust agreement shall provide that no revenue bonds issued thereunder shall be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless certified or authenticated by the trustee for the holders of the revenue bonds, signatures of the officers of the State upon the bonds required by section 39-56 may be facsimiles of their signatures;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (11)\u00a0 Proceeds of the revenue bonds may be used and applied by the department to reimburse the other person to the special facility lease for all preliminary costs and expenses, including architectural and legal costs; and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (12)\u00a0 If the special facility lease shall require the other person to operate, maintain, and repair the special facility which is the subject of the lease, at the other person's expense, the requirement shall constitute compliance by the department with section 39-61(a)(2), and none of the revenues derived by the department from the special facility shall be required to be applied to the purposes of section 39-62(2).\u00a0 Sections 39-62(4), 39-62(5), and 39-62(6) shall not be applicable to the revenues derived from a special facility lease.
