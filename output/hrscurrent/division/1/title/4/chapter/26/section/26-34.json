[L Sp 1959 2d, c 1, \u00a75; Supp, \u00a714A-3; HRS \u00a726-34; am L 1971, c 143, \u00a73; am L 1984, c 54, \u00a71 and c 72, \u00a71; am L 1985, c 153, \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nAttorney General Opinions\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 The board of election inspectors are within the purview of this section and any vacancy occurring must be filled as prescribed by the state constitution.\u00a0 Att. Gen. Op. 67-16.\n\u00a0 Members whose terms are subject to this section hold over upon expiration of their terms of office as de facto officers; but members authorized to hold over until successors are appointed and qualified, as in \u00a7304-3, hold over as de jure officers.\u00a0 Att. Gen. Op. 73-7.\n\u00a0 While the title or status of de facto officers may not be collaterally attacked, the de facto status is no defense in a quo warranto proceeding.\u00a0 Att. Gen. Op. 73-7.\n\u00a0 A board member who has served a partial term followed by a complete term may continue to serve until he has served eight consecutive years.\u00a0 Att. Gen. Op. 74-4.\n\u00a0 There is no statutory provision which sets forth the length of time the governor has to make a nomination.\u00a0 Att. Gen. Op. 80-4.\n\u00a0 In the absence of other statutory wording to the contrary, the holdover provision from subsection (b) would apply to board and commission statutes that refer to this section; the provision is constitutional.\u00a0 Att. Gen. Op. 16-3.\n\u00a0 The word \"appointed\" in subsection (b) does not purport to prevent the governor from exercising the governor's authority to make interim appointments; there is no conflict between subsection (b) and article V, \u00a76 of the state constitution.\u00a0 Therefore, subsection (b) is constitutional.\u00a0 Att. Gen. Op. 16-3.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Issue of legality of board members holding office after expiration of eight years held moot and was not decided.\u00a0 59 H. 244, 580 P.2d 405.\n\u00a0 A member of the land use commission did not qualify as a de facto officer, where, among other things, the senate rejected the member's nomination for a second term, which effectively served as public notice that the member was ineligible to serve as a holdover member.\u00a0 132 H. 184, 320 P.3d 849 (2013).\n\u00a0 The intermediate court of appeals erred in determining that a member of the land use commission continued to serve as a valid holdover after the senate's rejection of the member's nomination for a second term; the member's actions with respect to a petition to reclassify land were invalid.\u00a0 132 H. 184, 320 P.3d 849 (2013)."
