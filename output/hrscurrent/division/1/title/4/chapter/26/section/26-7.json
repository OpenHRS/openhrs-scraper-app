Gen. Op. 16-3.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Compromise agreement resolving legal claim against board of land and natural resources was not binding on State without attorney general's approval.\u00a0 57 H. 259, 554 P.2d 761.\n\u00a0 Attorney general may represent a state employee in a civil action while prosecuting the same employee in a criminal matter.\u00a0 71 H. 598, 801 P.2d 548.\n\u00a0 Without express authorization of employees' retirement system board, attorney general lacked power to file appeal on board's behalf from circuit court's final order; where attorney general perceived conflict of interest with board, attorney general was ethically obligated to recommend retention of other counsel to represent board and take other appropriate action.\u00a0 87 H. 152, 952 P.2d 1215."
