ownership to the trailer, as provided in subsections (h) and (i), and has delivered the certificate of registration bearing the transferor's signature to the transferee as required by subsection (a), the transferor shall be relieved from liability, civil or criminal, which the transferor might subsequently incur by reason of being the registered owner of the trailer.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (k)\u00a0 A dealer or manufacturer who has forwarded a properly endorsed certificate of registration to the director of finance shall be relieved of any civil liability, only if, in addition to the
