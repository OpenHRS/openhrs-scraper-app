Rev. 607 (2009).\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Section 291E-20 does not authorize law enforcement officers conducting sobriety checkpoints to pursue and detain drivers of motor vehicles appearing to avoid the sobriety checkpoints in a lawful manner; permitting officers to do so was beyond the lawful scope of the statutory procedures and, therefore, more intrusive than the standards and guidelines described in \u00a7291E-20 and violative of this section.\u00a0 113 H. 283, 151 P.3d 764."
