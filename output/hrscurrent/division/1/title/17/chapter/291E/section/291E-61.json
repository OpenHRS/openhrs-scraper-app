provided that, if the requirement is subsequently reversed, a requirement for the installation of an ignition interlock device shall be imposed as provided in this section.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (h)\u00a0 Whenever a court sentences a person pursuant to subsection (b), it also shall require that the offender be referred to the driver's education program for an assessment, by a certified substance abuse counselor, of the offender's substance abuse or dependence and the need for appropriate treatment.\u00a0 The counselor shall submit a report with recommendations to the court.\u00a0 The court shall require the offender to obtain appropriate treatment if the counselor's assessment establishes the offender's substance abuse or dependence.\u00a0 All costs for assessment and treatment shall be borne by the offender.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (i)\u00a0 Upon proof that the defendant has:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 Installed an ignition interlock device in any vehicle the defendant operates pursuant to subsection (b); and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 Obtained motor vehicle insurance or self-insurance that complies with the requirements under either section 431:10C-104 or section 431:10C-105,\nthe court shall issue an ignition interlock permit that will allow the defendant to drive a vehicle equipped with an ignition interlock device during the revocation period.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (j)\u00a0 Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, whenever a court revokes a person's driver's license pursuant to this section, the examiner of drivers shall not grant to the person a new driver's license until the expiration of the period of revocation determined by the court.\u00a0 After the period of revocation is completed, the person may apply for and the examiner of drivers may grant to the person a new driver's license.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (k)\u00a0 Any person sentenced under this section may be ordered to reimburse the county for the cost of any blood or urine tests conducted pursuant to section 291E-11.\u00a0 The court shall order the person to make restitution in a lump sum, or in a series of prorated installments, to the police department or other agency incurring the expense of the blood or urine test.\u00a0 Except as provided in section 291E-5, installation and maintenance of the ignition interlock device required by subsection (b) shall be at the defendant's own expense.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (l)\u00a0 As used in this section, the term \"examiner of drivers\" has the same meaning as provided in section 286-2.

thus, as record contained sufficient evidence that defendant committed the offense of operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant under subsections (a) and (b)(1) (2004), case remanded for entry of judgment and resentencing under subsections (a) and (b)(1) (2004).\u00a0 114 H. 411, 163 P.3d 1148 (2007).\n\u00a0 Where prosecution failed to present sufficient foundational evidence for either the REA blood alcohol chemical testing procedure or the Abbott AxSYM testing instrument used to perform defendant's blood alcohol test, prosecution failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt as required under this section that defendant was operating a vehicle with .08 or more grams of alcohol per one hundred milliliters or cubic centimeters of blood; appeals court thus erred in affirming district court's admission into evidence of defendant's test results without a proper foundation.\u00a0 121 H. 274, 218 P.3d 762 (2009).\n\u00a0 Although the oral charge tracked the language of this section, where the charge failed to allege that defendant was driving defendant's vehicle upon a public way, street, road, or highway at the time of the offense, the charge was deficient, as the term \"operate\" as defined in \u00a7291E-1 did not comport with its commonly understood definition, required the conduct to take place \"upon a public way, street, road, or highway\", and was neither \"unmistakable\" nor \"readily comprehensible to persons of common understanding\".\u00a0 121 H. 383, 219 P.3d 1170 (2009).\n\u00a0 Section 291E-1 establishes an attendant circumstance of the offense of operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant (OVUII), i.e., that the defendant's conduct occur \"upon a public way, street, road, or highway\"; the definition of \"operate\" in \u00a7291E-1 refers generally to the conduct of \"operating\" a vehicle under the influence as described in the title of this section, whether the conduct consists of driving the vehicle or otherwise assuming actual physical control of it; thus, the operation of a vehicle on a public way, street, road, or highway is an attendant circumstance of the offense of OVUII and therefore an element of the offense.\u00a0 121 H. 383, 219 P.3d 1170 (2009).\n\u00a0 An appellate court's remand for entry of judgment of conviction and resentencing for a lesser-included offense must be based on a jurisdictionally valid lesser-included charge; where defendant's charge under \u00a7291E-61.5 did not adequately allege the lesser-included offense of operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant as a first offender under this section because the charge failed to allege an essential element, specifically, the attendant circumstance that defendant operated a vehicle on a public road, way, street, or highway, the appellate court did not err in vacating and remanding circuit court case.\u00a0 126 H. 475, 273 P.3d 1161 (2012).\n\u00a0 A charge of operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant (OVUII) under subsection (a)(1) must allege the requisite mens rea in order to fully define the offense in unmistakable terms readily comprehensible to persons of common understanding, whereas an OVUII charge under subsection (a)(3) is an absolute liability offense for which mens rea need not be alleged or proven.\u00a0 127 H. 48, 276 P.3d 617 (2012).\n\u00a0 As the distinction between general and specific intent has been abandoned, appellate court erred in relying on general intent cases to hold that mens rea may be inferred from the allegations in an operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant charge under subsection (a)(1).\u00a0 127 H. 48, 276 P.3d 617 (2012).\n\u00a0 A prior judgment of acquittal on a subsection (a)(3) method of proof in an operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant trial is \"in form only\", but it serves as a factual finding that the State has not met its burden of proving breath alcohol content.\u00a0 As such, the collateral estoppel principle embodied in the double jeopardy clause of article I, \u00a710 of the Hawaii constitution and article V of the U.S. Constitution prohibits the State from re-litigating breath alcohol content, whether in a re-prosecution of defendant on the subsection (a)(3) method of proof, or as part of the State's evidence in a subsequent trial on the subsection (a)(1) method of proof.\u00a0 129 H. 146, 296 P.3d 359 (2013).\n\u00a0 Where it was undisputed that the complaint against defendant failed to allege a mens rea and, therefore, was insufficient to charge a violation of subsection (a)(1), on remand, the charge under subsection (a)(1) should be dismissed without prejudice.\u00a0 131 H. 1, 313 P.3d 690 (2013).\n\u00a0 Where the written submission of plea form in which defendant entered a plea of no contest solely to the subsection (a)(1) method of proof, was silent regarding subsection (a)(3), and the hearing transcript revealed some ambiguity as to the State's and district court's understandings of the plea, the court construed the State as having given up its ability to prosecute defendant under subsection (a)(3) in exchange for defendant's conditional plea under subsection (a)(1); in these circumstances, permitting the State to prosecute defendant under subsection (a)(3) would allow the State to avoid its end of the bargain, and would thereby violate defendant's due process rights.\u00a0 131 H. 1, 313 P.3d 690 (2013).\n\u00a0 The oral charge for operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant was defective because it omitted the requisite state of mind of intentional, knowing, or reckless.\u00a0 131 H. 215, 317 P.3d 659 (2013).\n\u00a0 Complaint was not insufficient for failing to allege a mens rea where complaint alleged all the essential elements of the charged operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant offense and provided the defendant with fair notice of the offense charged; with respect to the violation of subsection (a)(3), the violation is an absolute liability offense that does not require proof of mens rea, and with respect to the violation of subsection (a)(1), mens rea is not an essential element of that violation and could be inferred from the allegations in the complaint.\u00a0 125 H. 232 (App.), 257 P.3d 245 (2011).\n\u00a0 Full retroactive application of the Wheeler rule, i.e., the holding that an operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant (OVUII) charge is deficient if it charges in the language of subsection (a) without specifically alleging the public-road element, to cases on collateral review was not warranted; limited or pipeline retroactive effect was sufficient and appropriate.\u00a0 Moreover, appellant had not shown that the deficiency in the OVUII charge entitled appellant to relief on collateral review.\u00a0 131 H. 153 (App.), 315 P.3d 779 (2013)."
