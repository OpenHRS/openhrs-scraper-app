[L 1971, c 150, pt of \u00a71; am L 1984, c 273, \u00a78; gen ch 1985; am L 2002, c 160, \u00a710; am L 2004, c 102, \u00a72; am L 2006, c 129, \u00a73]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Speeding law not criminal, therefore, not assimilated under the Assimilative Crimes Act.\u00a0 900 F.2d 1346.\n\u00a0 Traffic citation issued to defendant on a military installation, referencing only Hawaii state law (this section) and reciting the facts of defendant's speeding violation, provided insufficient notice to defendant that defendant faced a criminal violation of federal law.\u00a0 537 F. Supp. 2d 1116 (2008).\n\u00a0 In prosecution under this section, prosecutor has burden of proving that speed limit was established in one of ways specified in this section.\u00a0 57 H. 277, 554 P.2d 767.\n\u00a0 Tuning fork used to calibrate radar gun was itself accurately calibrated.\u00a0 70 H. 580, 779 P.2d 11.\n\u00a0 Where trial court properly took judicial notice of the speed limit, as required by HRE rule 202(b), there was sufficient evidence to find motorist guilty of violating subsection (a).\u00a0 95 H. 22, 18 P.3d 884.\n\u00a0 The State failed to lay an adequate foundation for the introduction of the laser gun reading, and thus the trial court erred in admitting the speed reading into evidence.\u00a0 132 H. 170, 319 P.3d 1178 (2014).\n\u00a0 Defendant was effectively put on notice of allegedly exceeding speed limit established by county ordinance.\u00a0 9 H. App. 73, 823 P.2d 154.\n\u00a0 State's mere showing that the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to establish that defendant committed the lesser included regular speeding infraction (RSI) under subsection (a)(1) was not enough, by itself, to warrant the entry of judgment on the RSI; such a showing would be sufficient to justify remanding defendant's case for retrial on the lesser included RSI; to warrant remand for entry of judgment on the RSI, the State had to also show that the erroneous admission of the speed check evidence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt as to the determination that defendant committed the RSI.\u00a0 124 H. 270 (App.), 241 P.3d 562 (2010).\n\u00a0 Where there was no reasonable possibility that the erroneous admission of the speed check card might have affected the district court's finding that defendant drove defendant's car in excess of the maximum fifty-five miles per hour speed limit, the erroneous admission was harmless reasonable doubt with respect to the lesser included regular speeding infraction. \u00a0124 H. 270 (App.), 241 P.3d 562 (2010)."
