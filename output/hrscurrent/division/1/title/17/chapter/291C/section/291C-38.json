colors where the pavement itself does not provide sufficient contrast.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b)\u00a0 Lane markings shall conform to the following concepts:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 White lines indicate the separation of lanes of traffic flowing in the same direction.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 Yellow lines indicate the separation of lanes of traffic flowing in opposing directions or the left boundary of a traffic lane at a particularly hazardous location.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (3)\u00a0 Red markings indicate a roadway that shall not be entered or used by the viewer of those markings.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (4)\u00a0 Broken lines are permissive in character.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (5)\u00a0 Solid lines are restrictive in character.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (6)\u00a0 A wider line indicates a greater degree of emphasis.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (7)\u00a0 Double lines indicate maximum restriction.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (8)\u00a0 Markings which require visible emphasis at night shall be reflectorized.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (c)\u00a0 Longitudinal traffic lane markings shall have the following applications:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 A broken white line is used to indicate the edge of the traffic lane where travel is permitted in the same direction on both sides of the line and may be crossed by vehicular traffic when the crossing can be made with safety.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 A broken yellow line is used to indicate the left edge of a traffic lane where traffic on the other side of the line moves in the opposite direction and may be crossed by vehicular traffic only when overtaking or passing a vehicle proceeding in the same direction or when executing a left turn and then only if the movement can be made with safety and does not interfere with traffic moving in the opposite direction.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (3)\u00a0 A solid white line is used to indicate the edge of the traffic lane where travel in the same direction is permitted on both sides of the line but where movement from lane to lane is considered to be hazardous.\u00a0 A solid white line may be crossed only in unusual circumstances and then only with great care.\u00a0 A double width solid white line is used to emphasize a greater degree of hazard.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (4)\u00a0 A solid white line is also used to indicate the right edge of the pavement.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (5)\u00a0 A double solid white line is used to indicate the edges of traffic lanes where travel in the same direction is permitted on both sides of the double line but where movement from lane to lane is considered to be dangerous.\u00a0 The crossing of a double solid white line by vehicular traffic is prohibited.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (6)\u00a0 A solid yellow line is used to indicate the left edge of a traffic lane where overtaking and passing on the left is prohibited.\u00a0 The crossing of a solid yellow line by vehicular traffic is prohibited except when the crossing is part of a left turn movement.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (7)\u00a0 A solid yellow line is also used to indicate the left edge of each roadway of a divided street or highway.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (8)\u00a0 A double solid yellow line is used to indicate the separation between lanes of traffic moving in opposite directions.\u00a0 The crossing of a double solid yellow line by vehicular traffic is prohibited except when the crossing is part of a left turn movement.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (9)\u00a0 A double line consisting of a broken yellow line and a solid yellow line is used to indicate a separation between lanes of traffic moving in opposite directions and vehicular traffic adjacent to the broken line is permitted to overtake or pass if the movement can be made with safety and does not interfere with traffic moving in the opposite direction.\u00a0 The crossing of this double line by vehicular traffic adjacent to the solid line is prohibited except when the crossing is part of a left turn movement.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (10)\u00a0 A double broken yellow line is used to indicate the edge of a reversible traffic lane where the direction of the vehicular traffic may be changed from time to time.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (11)\u00a0 A dotted line is used to indicate the extension of a line through an intersection or interchange.\u00a0 It shall be the same color as the line it extends.\u00a0 The crossing of a dotted line by vehicular traffic is subject to the same prohibitions and exceptions as are applicable to the line it extends.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (12)\u00a0 A solid white line when supplemented by official signs or pavement markings, is used to indicate the separation of bicycle lanes from lanes of vehicular traffic flowing in the same direction.\u00a0 Except as allowed under section 291C-123, vehicles other than bicycles shall be prohibited from operating in a bicycle lane.
