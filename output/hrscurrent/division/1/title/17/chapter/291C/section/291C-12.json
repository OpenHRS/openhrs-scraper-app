[L 1971, c 150, pt of \u00a71; gen ch 1985; am L 1992, c 243, \u00a74; am L 2002, c 160, \u00a77; am L 2008, c 231, \u00a77]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 One cannot be convicted of both attempted murder by driving over another and a violation of this section.\u00a0 1 H. App. 625, 623 P.2d 1271.\n\u00a0 Failure to stop offense committed prior to 1992 amendment must be sentenced as a class C felony.\u00a0 9 H. App. 333, 839 P.2d 1186.\n\u00a0 Criminal liability under subsection (a) does not require proof that the driver of a vehicle caused injury to or death of a person, but only that the accident the driver was involved in resulted in injury to or death of any person; under subsection (a), a driver is \"involved in an accident\" when driver's vehicle is affected or implicated in the accident.\u00a0 77 H. 329 (App.), 884 P.2d 392.\n\u00a0 Not inconsistent that jury found defendant not guilty of negligent homicide in third degree, but guilty of intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly failing to stop at accident scene.\u00a0 77 H. 329 (App.), 884 P.2d 392.\n\u00a0 Where (1) traffic accident victim, and not defendant, caused the accident, (2) it appeared that victim's vehicle flipped over on its roof causing victim's immediate death upon impact, and (3) there was no evidence in the record that defendant's criminal misconduct of failing to remain at the scene of the accident, provide information, and render reasonable assistance pursuant to this section and \u00a7291C-14 caused victim's injuries or death, no nexus between defendant's conduct and victim's injuries and death had been demonstrated; thus, restitution could not be imposed under \u00a7706-646.\u00a0 121 H. 191 (App.), 216 P.3d 117 (2009).\n\u00a0 This section does not speak in terms of requiring a driver to complete the requirements of \u00a7291C-14(a) only; this section allows compliance by satisfying the requirements of either \u00a7291C-14(a) or (b); the prosecution needs to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant failed to fulfill the requirements under \u00a7291C-14(a) or (b), which set forth specific conduct constituting the offense.\u00a0 The requirements in \u00a7291C-14(a) and (b) were essential elements that needed to be included in the charge; the mere reference to \u00a7291C-14 in the indictment was insufficient to allege the specific requirements in \u00a7291C-14(a) and (b) that petitioner was alleged to have contravened.\u00a0\u00a0 129 H. 30, 292 P.3d 1260 (2013)."
