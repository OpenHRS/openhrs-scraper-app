[L 1971, c 150, pt of \u00a71; am L 1984, c 273, \u00a74; gen ch 1985; am L 1992, c 243, \u00a75; am L 2008, c 231, \u00a711]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Section did not violate defendant's privilege against self-incrimination.\u00a0 64 H. 479, 643 P.2d 541.\n\u00a0 An offense under \u00a7291C-15 is an included offense under this section and \u00a7291C-13.\u00a0 9 H. App. 156, 828 P.2d 298.\n\u00a0 Where (1) traffic accident victim, and not defendant, caused the accident, (2) it appeared that victim's vehicle flipped over on its roof causing victim's immediate death upon impact, and (3) there was no evidence in the record that defendant's criminal misconduct of failing to remain at the scene of the accident, provide information, and render reasonable assistance pursuant to \u00a7291C-12 and this section caused victim's injuries or death, no nexus between defendant's conduct and victim's injuries and death had been demonstrated; thus, restitution could not be imposed under \u00a7706-646.\u00a0 121 H. 191 (App.), 216 P.3d 117 (2009).\n\u00a0 Section 291C-12 does not speak in terms of requiring a driver to complete the requirements of subsection (a) only; \u00a7291C-12 allows compliance by satisfying the requirements of either subsection (a) or (b); the prosecution needs to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant failed to fulfill the requirements under subsection (a) or (b), which set forth specific conduct constituting the offense.\u00a0 The requirements in subsections (a) and (b) were essential elements that needed to be included in the charge; the mere reference to this section in the indictment was insufficient to allege the specific requirements in subsections (a) and (b) that petitioner was alleged to have contravened.\u00a0\u00a0 129 H. 30, 292 P.3d 1260 (2013)."
