substantially as follows:\n\u00a0\nNONRESIDENT VIOLATOR COMPACT\n\u00a0\nARTICLE I.\u00a0 FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (a)\u00a0 The party states find that:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 Under present procedures, a nonresident motorist who is arrested in a state other than the nonresident's home state must either post collateral or bond to secure appearance for trial at some later date, or, if unable to post such collateral or bond, the nonresident is taken into custody until collateral or bond is posted or taken directly to court for arraignment to be held.\u00a0 The purpose of this requirement is to obviate the difficulty of ensuring compliance with the terms of a traffic citation by the nonresident who, if permitted to continue on the nonresident's way after receiving such citation, could return to the nonresident's home state and disregard with impunity the nonresident's duty under the terms of the citation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 A motorist receiving a traffic citation in the motorist's home state is permitted, except for certain violations, to accept the citation from the officer at the scene of the violation and to immediately continue on the motorist's way after being instructed to comply with the terms of the citation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (3)\u00a0 The practice described in paragraph (1) causes unnecessary inconvenience and, at times, causes a hardship for the motorist who is unable at the time to post collateral, furnish a bond, stand trial, or pay the fine and thus is compelled to remain in custody until some arrangement can be made.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (4)\u00a0 The arrest of a nonresident motorist for a motor vehicle violation is presently consuming an undue amount of law enforcement time.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b)\u00a0 It is the policy of each of the party states to:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 Promote compliance with the laws, ordinances, and administrative rules relating to the operation of motor vehicles by their operators in each of the jurisdictions where such operators drive motor vehicles.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 Make the reciprocal recognition of the right of motorists of the party states to accept a citation without delay in all traffic violation cases in which such procedure is permitted whether the motorist is a resident or a nonresident of the state in which the arrest was made.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (3)\u00a0 Maximize effective utilization of law enforcement personnel and assist the court systems in the efficient disposition of traffic violations.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (4)\u00a0 Consider an operator who ignores or refuses a citation from a party state to be an unfit or irresponsible person to hold a license to drive.\n\u00a0\nARTICLE II.\u00a0 DEFINITIONS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As used in this

regulation which requires the motorist to respond.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b)\u00a0 \"Collateral\" means any bond, cash, or other security deposited to secure an appearance for trial following the issuance by an arresting officer of a citation for a traffic violation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (c)\u00a0 \"Compact administrator\" means the administrative director of the courts or designee.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (d)\u00a0 \"Driver's license\" means any license to operate a motor vehicle issued under the laws of the home state.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (e)\u00a0 \"Home state\" means the state that has issued and has the power to suspend or revoke the use of the license or permit to operate a motor vehicle.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (f)\u00a0 \"Issuing state\" means the state in which the traffic citation was issued to the motorist.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (g)\u00a0 \"Licensing authority\" means the administrative director of the courts or designee.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (h)\u00a0 \"Motorist\" means the driver of a motor vehicle operating in a party state other than the home state.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (i)\u00a0 \"Nonresident\"

such motorist's personal recognizance that the motorist will comply with the terms of the citation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b)\u00a0 No motorist shall be entitled to receive a citation under the

or\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 An offense, for which the revocation of the motorist's license would be required upon conviction or forfeiture of collateral.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (c)\u00a0

arrest was made or a citation for a traffic violation was issued, the licensing authority of the home state shall notify the motorist and immediately initiate license suspension proceedings against such motorist.\u00a0 The order of suspension shall indicate the reason for the order and shall notify the motorist that the motorist's license shall remain suspended until satisfactory evidence has been furnished to the authority issuing such order of compliance with the terms of the citation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (c)\u00a0 A copy of any suspension order issued under this Article shall be

suspension order issued under this Article shall be furnished to the compact administrator.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (d)\u00a0 If the laws of a home state do not provide for offenses or violations denominated or described in precisely the words employed in the state from which a certification of noncompliance is received, the home state shall construe the denomination and descriptions appearing in the laws of such state as being applicable to and identifying those offenses or violations of a substantially similar nature.\n\u00a0\nARTICLE V.\u00a0 APPLICABILITY OF OTHER LAWS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Except as expressly required by provisions of this compact, nothing contained herein shall be construed to affect the right of any party state to apply any of its other laws relating to the licenses to drive to any person or circumstance, nor to invalidate or prevent any driver license agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a party state and a nonparty state.\n\u00a0\nARTICLE VI.\u00a0 COMPACT ADMINISTRATOR AND\nINTERCHANGE OF INFORMATION\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (a)\u00a0 The motor vehicle administrator of each party state shall
