[L 1977, c 178, pt of \u00a72; am L 1987, c 270, \u00a713; am L 1997, c 336, \u00a711]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 State health planning and development agency administrator was not disqualified from participating in the reconsideration of respondent's certificate of need pursuant to \u00a711-1-25(a)(4), Hawaii administrative rules (HAR), which prohibits a hearings officer from hearing or deciding a contested case in which the hearings officer substantially participated in making the decision or action contested, given that in crafting this section, the legislature clearly intended that the administrator participate in both the initial decision on a certificate of need, and in any reconsideration of that decision.\u00a0 Further, because \u00a711-1-25(a)(4), HAR, conflicts with that intent, it would be invalid if applied in the circumstances of this case, and thus was inapplicable.\u00a0 130 H. 95, 306 P.3d 140 (2013)."
