and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (5)\u00a0 Such other factors as the department deems pertinent.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (g)\u00a0 The department may suspend enforcement of the financial responsibility requirements for a particular class or category of underground storage tanks or tank systems if the department determines that methods of financial responsibility satisfying the requirements of this section are not generally available for underground storage tanks or tank systems in that class or category, and:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 Steps are being taken to form a risk retention group for the class of tanks or tank systems; or\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 The State is taking steps to establish a fund to be implemented by the department or local agencies and departments for response action and compensation for the class of tanks or tank systems.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The initial suspension by the department pursuant to this subsection may be for a period not to exceed one hundred eighty\u00a0 days.\u00a0 A determination to continue suspension may be made with respect to the same class or category at the end of the period, but only if substantial progress has been made in establishing a risk retention group, or the owners or operators in the class or category demonstrate, and the department finds, that the formation of such a group is not possible and that the State is unable or unwilling to establish such a fund described in paragraph (2).
