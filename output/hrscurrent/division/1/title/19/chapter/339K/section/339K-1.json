Hawaii as a party, and is in full force and effect between the State and any other state joining therein in accordance with the terms of the compact, which compact is substantially as follows:\n\u00a0\nARTICLE I.\u00a0 POLICY AND PURPOSE\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The party states recognize that low-level radioactive wastes are generated by essential activities and services that benefit the citizens of the states.\u00a0 It is further recognized that the protection of the health and safety of the citizens of the party states and the most economical management of low-level radioactive wastes can be accomplished through cooperation of the states in minimizing the amount of handling and transportation required to dispose of such wastes and through the cooperation of the states in providing facilities that serve the region.\u00a0 It is the policy of the party states to undertake the necessary cooperation to protect the health and safety of the citizens of the party states and to provide for the most economical management of low-level radioactive wastes on a continuing basis.\u00a0 It is the purpose of this compact to provide the means for such a cooperative effort among the party states so that the protection of the citizens of the states and the maintenance of the viability of the states' economies will be enhanced while sharing the responsibilities of low-level radioactive waste management.\n\u00a0\nARTICLE II.\u00a0 DEFINITIONS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As used in this compact:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (a)\u00a0 \"Facility\" means any site, location, structure, or property used or to be used for the storage, treatment, or disposal of low-level waste, excluding federal waste facilities.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b)\u00a0 \"Low-level waste\" means waste material which contains radioactive-nuclides emitting primarily beta or gamma radiation, or both, in concentrations or quantities which exceed applicable federal or state standards for unrestricted release.\u00a0 Low-level waste does not include waste containing more than ten nanocuries of transuranic contaminants per gram of material, nor spent reactor fuel, nor material classified as either high-level waste or waste which is unsuited for disposal by near-surface burial under any applicable federal regulations;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (c)\u00a0 \"Generator\" means any person, partnership, association, corporation, or any other entity whatsoever, which, as a part of its activities, produces low-level radioactive waste;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (d)\u00a0 \"Host state\" means a state in which a facility is located.\n\u00a0\nARTICLE III.\u00a0 REGULATORY PRACTICES\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Each party state hereby agrees to adopt practices which will require low-level waste shipments originating within its borders and destined for a facility within another party state to conform to the applicable packaging and transportation requirements and regulations of the host state.\u00a0 Such practices shall include:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (a)\u00a0 Maintaining an inventory of all generators within the state that have shipped or expect to ship low-level waste to facilities in another party state;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b)\u00a0 Periodic unannounced inspection of the premises of such generators and the waste management activities thereon;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (c)\u00a0 Authorization of the containers in which such waste may be shipped, and a requirement that generators use only that type of container authorized by the state;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (d)\u00a0 Assurance that inspection of the carriers which transport such waste are conducted by proper authorities, and appropriate enforcement action taken for violations;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (e)\u00a0 After receiving notification from a host state that a generator within the party state is in violation of applicable packaging or transportation standards, the party state will take appropriate action to assure that such violations do not recur.\u00a0 Such action may include inspection of every individual low-level waste shipment by that generator.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Each party state may impose fees upon generators and shippers to recover the cost of the inspections and other practices under this article.\u00a0 Nothing in this article shall be construed to limit any party state's authority to impose additional or more stringent standards on generators or carriers than those required under this article.\n\u00a0\nARTICLE IV.\u00a0 REGIONAL FACILITIES\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (a)\u00a0 Facilities located in any party state, other than facilities established or maintained by individual low-level waste generators for the management of their own low-level waste, shall accept low-level waste generated in any party state if such waste has been packaged and transported according to applicable laws and regulations.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b)\u00a0 After July\u00a01, 1983, no facility located in any party state may accept low-level waste generated outside of the region comprised of the party states, except as provided in article V.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (c)\u00a0 Until such time as paragraph (b) of article IV takes effect, facilities located in any party state may accept low-level waste generated outside of any of the party states only if such waste is accompanied by a certificate of compliance issued by an official of the state in which such waste shipment originated.\u00a0 Such certificate shall be in such form as may be required by the host state, and shall contain at least the following:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 The generator's name and address;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 A description of the contents of the low-level waste container;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (3)\u00a0 A statement that the low-level waste being shipped has been inspected by the official who issued the certificate or by his agent or by a representative of the United States nuclear regulatory commission, and found to have been packaged in compliance with applicable federal regulations and such additional requirements as may be imposed by the host state;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (4)\u00a0 A binding agreement by the state of origin to reimburse any party state for any liability or expense incurred as a result of an accidental release of such waste during shipment or after such waste reaches the facility.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (d)\u00a0 Each party state shall cooperate with the other party states in determining the appropriate site of any facility that might be required within the region comprised of the party states, in order to maximize public health and safety while minimizing the use of any one party state as the host of such facilities on a permanent basis.\u00a0 Each party state further agrees that decisions regarding low-level waste management facilities in their region will be reached through a good faith process which takes into account the burdens borne by each of the party states as well as the benefits each has received.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (e)\u00a0 The party states recognize that the issue of hazardous chemical waste management is similar in many respects to that of low-level waste management.\u00a0 Therefore, in consideration of the State of Washington allowing access to its low-level waste disposal facility by generators in other party states, party states such as Oregon and Idaho which host hazardous chemical waste disposal facilities will allow access to such facilities by generators within other party states.\u00a0 Nothing in this compact shall be construed to prevent any party state from limiting the nature and type of hazardous chemical or low-level wastes to be accepted at facilities within its borders or from ordering the closure of such facilities, so long as such action by a host state is applied equally to all generators within the region comprised of the party states.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (f)\u00a0 Any host state may establish a schedule of fees and requirements related to its facility, to assure that closure, perpetual care, and maintenance and contingency requirements are met, including adequate bonding.\n\u00a0\nARTICLE V.\u00a0 NORTHWEST LOW-LEVEL WASTE COMPACT COMMITTEE\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The governor of each party state shall designate one official of that state as the person responsible for administration of this compact.\u00a0 The officials so designated shall together comprise the Northwest low-level waste compact committee.\u00a0 The committee shall meet as required to consider matters arising under this compact.\u00a0 The officials shall inform the committee of existing regulations concerning low-level waste management in their states, and shall afford all other officials a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon any proposed modification in such regulations.\u00a0 Notwithstanding any provision of article IV to the contrary, the committee may enter into arrangements with states, provinces, individual generators, or regional compact entities outside the region comprised of the party states, for access to facilities on such terms and conditions as the committee may deem appropriate.\u00a0 However, it shall require a two-thirds vote of all such members, including the affirmative vote of the member of any party state in which a facility affected by such arrangement is located, for the committee to enter into such arrangement.\n\u00a0\nARTICLE VI.\u00a0 ELIGIBLE PARTIES AND EFFECTIVE DATE\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (a)\u00a0 Each of the following states is eligible to become a party to this compact:\u00a0 Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming.\u00a0 As to any eligible party, this compact shall become effective upon enactment into law by that party, but it shall not become initially effective until enactment into law by two states.\u00a0 Any party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing its approval.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b)\u00a0 After the compact has initially taken effect pursuant to paragraph (a) of this article, any eligible party state may become a party to this compact by the execution of an executive order by the governor of the state.\u00a0 Any state which becomes a party in this manner shall cease to be a party upon the final adjournment of the next general or regular session of its legislature or July\u00a01, 1983, whichever, occurs first, unless the compact has by then been enacted as a statute by that state.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (c)\u00a0 This compact shall take effect upon consent by congress.\u00a0 As provided in Public Law 96-573, congress may withdraw its consent to the compact after every five year period.\n\u00a0\nARTICLE VII.\u00a0 SEVERABILITY\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If any provision of this compact, or its application to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, all other provisions of this compact, and the application of all of its provisions to all other persons and circumstances, shall remain valid; and to this end the provisions of this compact are severable.
