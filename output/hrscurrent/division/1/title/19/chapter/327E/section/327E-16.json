care.\u00a0 Part 1 lets you name another individual as agent to make health-care decisions for you if you become incapable of making your own decisions or if you want someone else to make those decisions for you now even though you are still capable.\u00a0 You may name an alternate agent to act for you if your first choice is not willing, able, or reasonably available to make decisions for you.\u00a0 Unless related to you, your agent may not be an owner, operator, or employee of a health-care institution where you are receiving care.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Unless the form you sign limits the authority of your agent, your agent may make all health-care decisions for you.\u00a0 This form has a place for you to limit the authority of your agent.\u00a0 You need not limit the authority of your agent if you wish to rely on your agent for all health-care decisions that may have to be made.\u00a0 If you choose not to limit the authority of your agent, your agent will have the right to:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 Consent or refuse consent to any care, treatment, service, or procedure to maintain, diagnose, or otherwise affect a physical or mental

all other forms of health care.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Part 2 of this form lets you give specific instructions about any aspect of your health care.\u00a0 Choices are provided for you to express your wishes regarding the provision, withholding, or withdrawal of treatment to keep you alive, including the provision of artificial nutrition and hydration, as well as the provision of pain relief medication.\u00a0 Space is provided for you to add to the choices you have made or for you to write out any additional wishes.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Part 4 of this form lets you designate a physician to have primary responsibility for your health care.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After completing this form, sign and date the form at the end and have the form witnessed by one of the two alternative methods listed below.\u00a0 Give a copy of the signed and completed form to your physician, to any other health-care providers you may have, to any health-care institution at which you are receiving care, and to any health-care agents you have named.\u00a0 You should talk to the person you have named as agent to make sure that he or she understands your wishes and is willing to take the responsibility.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You have the right to revoke this advance health-care directive or replace this form at any time.\n\u00a0\nPART 1\nDURABLE POWER OF ATTORNEY FOR HEALTH-CARE
