and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (6)\u00a0 With regard to pain patients, the application of this section shall be guided by the medical principle that physical tolerance and dependence are normal consequences of sustained use of opiate medication, distinguishable from psychological dependency or addiction that bears no relationship to pain experienced by a patient.\u00a0 For the purposes of this section, psychological dependency shall be characterized by a patient's compulsion to take a drug notwithstanding the fact that the patient knows the harmful and destructive effect of the drug on the patient.\u00a0 The distinction is one of treatment of pain as opposed to feeding a psychological need.\u00a0 A patient who suffers severe acute pain or severe chronic pain secondary to a diagnosis in any form of disease and chronic conditions may be entitled to receive a prescription of opiate medication for the treatment of the pain, if requested by that patient; provided that:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (A)\u00a0 The particular opiate is appropriate to the treatment of that pain; and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (B)\u00a0 The patient is not addicted to the opiate.\u00a0 For the purposes of this subparagraph, the term \"addicted\" refers to a psychological dependence, rather than a progressive physical tolerance for the opiate to relieve the pain; provided that the term does not include a narcotic-dependent person as defined in section 329-40.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b)\u00a0 Nothing in this section shall be construed to:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 Expand the authorized scope of practice of any licensed physician;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 Limit any reporting or disciplinary provisions applicable to licensed physicians and surgeons who violate prescribing practices; and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (3)\u00a0 Prohibit the discipline or prosecution of a licensed physician for:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (A)\u00a0 Failing to maintain complete, accurate, and current records that document the physical examination and medical history of a patient, the basis for the clinical diagnosis of a patient, and the treatment plan for a patient;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (B)\u00a0 Writing false or fictitious prescriptions for controlled substances scheduled in the Federal Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, 21 United States Code 801 et seq. or in chapter 329;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (C)\u00a0 Prescribing, administering, or dispensing pharmaceuticals in violation of the provisions of the Federal Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, 21 United States Code 801 et seq. or of chapter 329;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (D)\u00a0 Diverting medications prescribed for a patient to the licensed physician's own personal use; and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (E)\u00a0 Causing, or assisting in causing, the suicide, euthanasia, or mercy killing of any individual; provided that it is not \"causing, or assisting in causing, the suicide, euthanasia, or mercy killing of any individual\" to prescribe, dispense, or administer medical treatment for the purpose of treating severe acute pain or severe chronic pain, even if the medical treatment may increase the risk of death, so long as the medical treatment is not also furnished for the purpose of causing, or the purpose of assisting in causing, death for any reason.
