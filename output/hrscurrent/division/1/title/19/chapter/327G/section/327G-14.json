own decisions, or if you want someone else to make those decisions for you now, even though you are still capable of making your own decisions.\u00a0 You may name alternate agents to act for you if your first choice is not willing, able, or reasonably available to make decisions for you.\u00a0 Unless related to you, your agent may not be an owner, operator, or employee of a health care institution where you are receiving care.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You may allow your agent to make all mental health treatment decisions for you.\u00a0 However, if you wish to limit the authority of

are provided for you to express your wishes regarding the provision, withholding, or withdrawal of medication and treatment.\u00a0 Space is provided for you to add to the choices you have made or for you to write out any additional wishes.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Part 4 of this form must be completed in order to activate the advance mental health care directive.\u00a0 After completing this form, sign and date the form at the end and have the form witnessed by one or both of the two methods listed below.\u00a0 Give a copy of the signed and completed form to your physician, to any other health care providers you may have, to any health care institution at which you are receiving care, and to any mental health care agents you have named.\u00a0 You should talk to the persons you have named as agents to make sure that they understand your wishes and are willing to take the responsibility.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You have the right to revoke this advance mental health care directive or replace this form at any time, unless otherwise specified in writing in the advance mental health care directive.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If you are in imminent danger of causing bodily harm to yourself or others, or have been involuntarily committed to a health care institution for mental health treatment, the advance mental health care directive will not apply.\n\u00a0\nPART 1\nCHECKLIST
