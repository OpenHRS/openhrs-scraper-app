because the governor is not involved, there is no conflict with Hawaiian homes commission act.\u00a0 87 H. 91, 952 P.2d 379.\n\u00a0 \"State lands\" in subsection (a)(1) includes Hawaiian home lands.\u00a0 87 H. 91, 952 P.2d 379.\n\u00a0 In order to achieve the salutary objectives of the Hawaii environmental policy act, and because developer's proposed underpasses had been, from the start, an integral part of the project, developer's proposed construction of two underpasses under highway constituted \"use of state lands\" within the meaning of subsection (a)(1).\u00a0 91 H. 94, 979 P.2d 1120.\n\u00a0 The proper inquiry for determining the necessity of an environmental impact statement (EIS) based on the language of subsection (c) is whether the proposed action will \"likely\" have a significant effect on the environment; as defined in \u00a7343-2, \"significant effect\" includes irrevocable commitment of natural resources; where the burning of thousands of gallons of fuel and the withdrawal of millions of gallons of groundwater on a daily basis would \"likely\" cause such irrevocable commitment, an EIS was required pursuant to both the common meaning of \"may\" and the statutory definition of \"significant effect\".\u00a0 106 H. 270, 103 P.3d 939.\n\u00a0 Where department of Hawaiian home lands lease was executed in contravention of subsection (c) inasmuch as the condition precedent--acceptance of a required final environmental impact statement--was not satisfied, the lease was void.\u00a0 106 H. 270, 103 P.3d 939.\n\u00a0 Where all three elements under subsection (c) were present:\u00a0 (1) an applicant proposed an action specified by subsection (a), (2) the action required the approval of an agency, and (3) the action was not exempt under \u00a7343-6, the land use commission, as the agency that received the request for approval of the boundary amendment petition, was required by statute to prepare an environmental assessment of the proposed action at the earliest practical time.\u00a0 109 H. 411, 126 P.3d 1098.\n\u00a0 Where the record showed that the department of transportation did not consider whether its facilitation of the Hawaii superferry project would probably have minimal or no significant impacts, both primary and secondary, on the environment, its determination that the improvements to Kahului harbor were exempt from the requirements of this chapter was erroneous as a matter of law; the exemption thus being invalid, the environmental assessment of this section was applicable.\u00a0 115 H. 299, 167 P.3d 292.\n\u00a0 Trial court did not err in determining that there was no \"use\" of state or county land under subsection (a)(1) where developer's detention basins and drainage line was merely connected and routed through the existing street drainage system and developer's sewage lines were connected to the county's existing sewage lines as neither line would require tunneling or construction beneath state or county lands.\u00a0 119 H. 90, 194 P.3d 531.\n\u00a0 While chapter 150A and the board's microorganism import rules may have vested the board with exclusive authority to approve marine biotechnology firm's proposal to import and grow genetically engineered algae at the State's research and technology park, as the demonstration project constituted an action that proposed the use of state land, this section plainly and unambiguously required the preparation of an environmental assessment before the board could approve firm's application.\u00a0 118 H. 247 (App.), 188 P.3d 761.\n\u00a0 Where record in the case showed no substantive change in the project, nor any evidence that the subdivision application proposed \"any use within a shoreline area as defined in \u00a7205A-41\", as required in subsection (a)(3), thereby making the subdivision application an \"action\" under \u00a7343-2 that required a supplemental environmental impact statement, once the environmental impact statement had been accepted, no other statement for the proposed project was required under subsection (g).\u00a0 120 H. 457 (App.), 209 P.3d 1271. \n\u00a0 Where there were genuine issues of material fact regarding whether the church building project site was included in the National and Hawaii (historic) registers, thus triggering the requirement for an environmental assessment under this section, the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment by finding that only the church structure itself, and not the church building project site, was included in the National and Hawaii registers.\u00a0 128 H. 455 (App.), 290 P.3d 525 (2012)."
