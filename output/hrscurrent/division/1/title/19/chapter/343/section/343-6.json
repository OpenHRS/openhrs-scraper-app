Rev. 249 (2013).\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Project requiring completely new drainage system serving over 300 residences was qualitatively incompatible with both letter and intent of administrative rules implementing subsection (a)(7) which intended to exempt only very minor projects from requirements of this chapter.\u00a0 86 H. 66, 947 P.2d 378.\n\u00a0 Where all three elements under \u00a7343-5(c) were present:\u00a0 (1) an applicant proposed an action specified by \u00a7343-5(a), (2) the action required the approval of an agency, and (3) the action was not exempt under this section, the land use commission, as the agency that received the request for approval of the boundary amendment petition, was required by statute to prepare an environmental assessment of the proposed action at the earliest practical time.\u00a0 109 H. 411, 126 P.3d 1098.\n\u00a0 The environmental council is expressly granted the power to promulgate rules regarding environmental impact statements, and it clearly contemplates the possibility of changes to an original project that may dictate the need for a supplemental environmental impact statement (SEIS); the rules promulgated to address SEISs, including HAR \u00a7\u00a711-200-26 and 11-200-27, were within the implied powers reasonably necessary to carry out the powers expressly granted; as the SEIS process was consistent with the Hawaii environmental protection act, the council did not exceed its authority in promulgating rules to guide the SEIS process, including HAR \u00a7\u00a711-200-26 and 11-200-27.\u00a0 123 H. 150, 231 P.3d 423 (2010)."
