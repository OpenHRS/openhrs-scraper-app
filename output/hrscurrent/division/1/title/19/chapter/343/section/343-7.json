Rev. 581 (2011).\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Plaintiff's claims that Hawai'i environmental policy act was violated were barred; plaintiff did not submit comment and filed suit more than sixty days after office of environmental quality control informed the public that the state final environmental impact statement had been accepted.\u00a0 307 F. Supp. 2d 1149.\n\u00a0 Court has no jurisdiction over actions initiated after time limit.\u00a0 64 H. 126, 637 P.2d 776.\n\u00a0 Date of commission's decision to grant SMA permit triggered time period for appeal, not date when commission made express determination that no environmental assessment was required for project; plaintiff's challenge to lack of environmental assessment thus timely.\u00a0 86 H. 66, 947 P.2d 378.\n\u00a0 Where the federal construct of a procedural right was not germane to case because this section, the statute at issue, establishes who and under what circumstances the lack of an environmental assessment, may be challenged, and federal cases recognizing this standard were inapposite because they rested on non-analogous statutes, petitioner could not be afforded so-called \"procedural standing\" under subsection (a).\u00a0 100 H. 242, 59 P.3d 877.\n\u00a0 Where Hawaiian homes commission did not accept the proposal for an environmental impact statement, the subject of the judicial proceeding before the trial court was not the \"acceptance\" of such statement; intervenors were not required to provide written comments pursuant to subsection (c) as subsection (c) did not apply; intervenor's objections, therefore, were subject to judicial review under subsection (b).\u00a0 106 H. 270, 103 P.3d 939.\n\u00a0 Appellants established standing where they showed threatened injuries under the traditional injury-in-fact test and procedural injuries based on a procedural right test; the threatened injury in fact was due to defendant's decision to go forward with harbor improvements and allow the superferry project to operate at Kahului harbor without conducting an environmental assessment; the procedural injury was based on various interests appellants identified that were threatened due to the violation of their procedural rights under this chapter.\u00a0 115 H. 299, 167 P.3d 292.\n\u00a0 Where this section waived the State's sovereign immunity against actions brought to challenge: \u00a0(1) the lack of an environmental assessment; (2) the determination that an environmental impact statement is or is not required; and (3) the acceptance of an environmental impact statement, sovereign immunity did not prevent the application of the private attorney general doctrine against the State and the circuit court did not err in relying on the doctrine as a basis for its award of attorney's fees against the State and superferry jointly.\u00a0 120 H. 181, 202 P.3d 1226.\n\u00a0 Although the subdivision application was part of the larger action (i.e., the project), the specific \"action\" for statute of limitations purposes was the date the subdivision application was approved, as opposed to when the project itself was originally approved; thus, where plaintiffs' initial complaint was filed within 120 days of the department of planning and permitting's approval of the subdivision application, plaintiffs' claims were not barred by this section.\u00a0 123 H. 150, 231 P.3d 423 (2010).\n\u00a0 Where there was no evidence that the city department of planning and permitting filed a notice with the office of environmental quality control pursuant to HAR \u00a711-200-11.1 of its determination that a supplemental environmental impact statement was not required, there was no date from which to measure the thirty day limitation prescribed by subsection (b) and subsection (b) was thus inapplicable; in addition, given the plain and unambiguous language of this section and \u00a7343-3, coupled with the related administrative rules, actual knowledge cannot be substituted for the public notice requirement.\u00a0 123 H. 150, 231 P.3d 423 (2010)."
