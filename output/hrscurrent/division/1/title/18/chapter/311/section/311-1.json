substantially as follows:\n\u00a0\nPREAMBLE\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 WHEREAS, the proper education of all citizens is one of the most important responsibilities of the States to preserve a free and open society in the United States; and,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 WHEREAS, the increasing demands of our whole national life for improving and expanding educational services require a broad exchange of research data and information concerning the problems and practices of education; and,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 WHEREAS, there is a vital need for strengthening the voices of the States in the formulation of alternative nationwide educational policies.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE STATES AFFIRM the need for close and continuing consultation among our several States on all matters of education, and do hereby establish this Compact for Education.\n\u00a0\nCOMPACT FOR EDUCATION\nARTICLE I.\u00a0 PURPOSE AND POLICY.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A.\u00a0 It is the purpose of this compact to:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1.\u00a0 Establish and maintain close cooperation and understanding among executive, legislative, professional, educational, and lay leadership on a nationwide basis at the state and local levels.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2.\u00a0 Provide a forum for the discussion, development, crystallization, and recommendation of public policy alternatives in the field of education.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3.\u00a0 Provide a clearing house of information on matters relating to educational problems and how they are being met in different places throughout the Nation, so that the executive and legislative branches of state government and of local communities may have ready access to the experience and record of the entire country, and so that both lay and professional groups in the field of education may have additional avenues for the sharing of experience and the interchange of ideas in the formation of public policy in education.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 4.\u00a0 Facilitate the improvement of state and local educational systems so that all of them will be able to meet adequate and desirable goals in a society which requires continuous qualitative and quantitative advance in educational opportunities, methods, and facilities.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 B.\u00a0 It is the policy of this compact to encourage and promote local and state initiative in the development, maintenance, improvement, and administration of educational systems and institutions in a manner which will accord with the needs and advantages of diversity among localities and states.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 C.\u00a0 The party states recognize that each of them has an interest in the quality and quantity of education furnished in each of the other states, as well as in the excellence of its own educational systems and institutions, because of the highly mobile character of individuals within the Nation, and because the products and services contributing to the health, welfare, and economic advancement of each state are supplied in significant part by persons educated in other states.\n\u00a0\nARTICLE II.\u00a0 STATE DEFINED.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As used in this Compact, \"state\" means a state, territory, or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\n\u00a0\nARTICLE III.\u00a0 THE COMMISSION.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A.\u00a0 The Education Commission of the States, hereinafter called \"the commission\", is hereby established.\u00a0

houses and serving in such manner as the legislature may determine; and four shall be appointed by and serve at the pleasure of the governor, unless the laws of the state otherwise provide.\u00a0 If the laws of a state prevent legislators from serving on the commission, six members shall be appointed by and serve at the pleasure of the governor, unless the laws of the state otherwise provide.\u00a0 In addition to any other principles or requirements which a state may establish for the appointment and service of its members of the commission, the guiding principle for the composition of the membership on the commission from each party state shall be that the members representing such state shall, by virtue of their training, experience, knowledge, or affiliations be in a position collectively to reflect broadly the interests of the state government, higher education, the state education system, local education, lay and professional, public and nonpublic educational leadership.\u00a0 Of those appointees, one shall be the head of a state agency or institution, designated by the governor, having responsibility for one or more programs of public education.\u00a0 In

commission, and together with the treasurer and such other personnel as the commission may deem appropriate shall be bonded in such amount as the commission shall determine.\u00a0 The executive director shall be secretary.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 E.\u00a0 Irrespective of the civil service, personnel, or other merit system laws of any of the party States, the executive director subject to the approval of the steering committee shall appoint, remove, or discharge such personnel as may be necessary for the performance of the functions of the commission, and shall fix the duties and compensation of such personnel.\u00a0 The commission in its bylaws shall provide for the personnel policies and programs of the commission.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 F.\u00a0 The commission may

grants of money, equipment, supplies, materials and services, conditional or otherwise, from any state, the United States, or any other governmental agency, or from any person, firm, association, foundation, or corporation, and may receive, utilize and dispose of the same.\u00a0 Any donation or grant accepted by the commission pursuant to this paragraph or services borrowed pursuant to paragraph F of this Article shall be reported in the annual report of the commission.\u00a0 Such report shall include the nature, amount, and conditions, if any, of the donation, grant, or services borrowed, and the identity of the donor or lender.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 H.\u00a0 The commission may establish and maintain such facilities as may be necessary for the transacting of its business.\u00a0 The commission may acquire, hold, and convey real and personal property and any interest therein.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I.\u00a0 The commission shall adopt bylaws for the conduct of its business and shall have the power to amend and rescind these bylaws.\u00a0 The commission shall publish its bylaws in convenient form and shall file a copy thereof and a copy of any amendment thereto, with the appropriate agency or officer in each of the party states.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 J.\u00a0 The commission annually shall make to the governor and legislature of each party state a report covering the activities of the commission for the preceding year.\u00a0 The commission may make such additional reports as it may deem desirable.\n\u00a0\nARTICLE IV.\u00a0

private.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 5.\u00a0 Formulate suggested policies and plans for the improvement of public education as a whole, or for any segment thereof, and make recommendations with respect

of any of its authority or functions pursuant to this compact.\n\u00a0\nARTICLE V.\u00a0 COOPERATION WITH FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A.\u00a0 If the laws of the United States specifically so provide, or if administrative provision is made therefor within the federal government, the United States may be represented on the commission by not to exceed ten representatives.\u00a0 Any such representative or representatives of the United States shall be appointed and serve in such manner as may be provided by or pursuant to federal law, and may be drawn from any one or more branches of the federal government, but no such representative shall have a vote on the commission.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 B.\u00a0 The commission may provide information and

commission is not meeting, the commission shall elect a steering committee of thirty-two members which, subject to the provisions of this compact and consistent with the policies of the commission, shall be constituted and function as provided in the bylaws of the commission.\u00a0 One-fourth of the voting membership of the steering committee shall consist of governors, one-fourth shall consist

service for a partial term of one year or less shall not be counted toward the two term limitation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 B.\u00a0 The commission may establish advisory and technical committees
