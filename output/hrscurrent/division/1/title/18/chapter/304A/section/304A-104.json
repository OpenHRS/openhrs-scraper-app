Gen. Op. 16-3.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Respondent's application of the holdover provision of subsection (a) to the six regents whose terms had expired contravened L 2007, Act 56, \u00a7\u00a71 and 5 and was contrary to the modified appointment process for regents prescribed by the Hawaii constitution, article X, \u00a76.\u00a0 119 H. 341, 198 P.3d 604 (2008).\n\u00a0 The governor's nondiscretionary duty\u0097pursuant to the Hawaii constitution, article X, \u00a76, \u00a7304A-104.5(e), and subsection (a)\u0097to nominate and appoint members of the board of regents of the University of Hawaii, is subject to a reasonable time standard; reasonable time is judged by the totality of the circumstances; the passage of nearly ten months since the governor was presented with the regent candidate list was an unreasonable period of time for the governor to perform this constitutional and statutory duty and the governor was thus subject to mandamus.\u00a0 119 H. 341, 198 P.3d 604 (2008)."
