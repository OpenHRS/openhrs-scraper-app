behalf of the State of Hawaii with any and all other States (as defined in the Agreement) legally enacting the Agreement in the form substantially as follows:\n\u00a0\nINTERSTATE AGREEMENT ON QUALIFICATION\nOF EDUCATIONAL PERSONNEL\n\u00a0\nARTICLE I\nPURPOSE, FINDINGS, AND POLICY\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1.\u00a0 The States party to this Agreement, desiring by common action to improve their respective school systems by utilizing the teacher or other professional educational person wherever educated, declare that it is the policy of each of them, on the basis of cooperation with one another, to take advantage of the preparation and experience of such persons wherever gained, thereby serving the best interests of society, of education, and of the teaching profession.\u00a0 It is the purpose of this Agreement to provide for the development and execution of such programs of cooperation as will facilitate the movement of teachers and other professional educational personnel among the States party to it, and to authorize specific interstate educational personnel contracts to achieve that end.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2.\u00a0 The party States find that included in the large movement of population among all sections of the nation are many qualified educational personnel who move for family and other personal reasons but who are hindered in using their professional skill and experience in their new locations.\u00a0 Variations from State to State in requirements for qualifying educational personnel discourage such personnel from taking the steps necessary to qualify in other States.\u00a0 As a consequence, a significant number of professionally prepared and experienced educators is lost to our school systems.\u00a0 Facilitating the employment of qualified educational personnel, without reference to their States of origin, can increase the available educational resources.\u00a0 Participation in this Compact can increase the availability of educational manpower.\n\u00a0\nARTICLE II\nDEFINITIONS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As used in this Agreement and contracts made pursuant to it, unless the context clearly requires otherwise:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1.\u00a0 \"Educational personnel\" means persons who must meet requirements pursuant to State law as a condition of employment in educational programs.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2.\u00a0 \"Designated State official\" means the education official of a State selected by that State to negotiate and enter into, on behalf of his State, contracts pursuant to this Agreement.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3.\u00a0 \"Accept\", or any variant thereof, means to recognize and give effect to one or more determinations of another State relating to the qualifications of educational personnel in lieu of making or requiring a like determination that would otherwise be required by or pursuant to the laws of a receiving State.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 4.\u00a0 \"State\" means a State, territory, or possession of the United States; the District of Columbia; or the Commonwealth  of Puerto Rico.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 5.\u00a0 \"Originating State\" means a State (and the subdivision thereof, if any) whose determination that certain educational personnel are qualified to be employed for specific duties in schools is acceptable in accordance with the terms of a contract made pursuant to Article III.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6.\u00a0 \"Receiving State\" means a State (and the subdivisions thereof) which accept educational personnel in

the period of its duration shall be applicable to and binding on the States whose designated state officials enter into it, and the subdivisions of those States, with the same force and effect as if incorporated in this Agreement.\u00a0 A designated state official may enter into a contract pursuant to this Article only with States in which he finds that there are programs of education, certification standards or other acceptable qualifications that assure preparation or qualification of educational personnel on a basis sufficiently comparable, even though not identical, to that prevailing in his own State.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2.\u00a0 Any such contract shall provide for:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (a)\u00a0 Its duration.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b)\u00a0 The criteria to be applied by an originating State in qualifying educational personnel for acceptance by a receiving State.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (c)\u00a0 Such waivers, substitutions, and conditional

pursuant to the terms of a contract shall not be revoked or otherwise impaired because the contract has expired or been terminated.\u00a0 However, any license or other qualifying document may be revoked or suspended on any ground which would be sufficient for revocation or suspension of a license or other qualifying document initially granted or approved in the receiving State.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6.\u00a0 A contract committee composed of the designated state officials of the contracting States or their representatives shall keep the contract under continuous review, study means of improving its administration, and report no less frequently than once a year to the heads of the appropriate education agencies of the contracting States.\n\u00a0\nARTICLE IV\nAPPROVED AND ACCEPTED PROGRAMS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1.\u00a0 Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to repeal or otherwise modify any law or regulation of a party State relating to the approval of programs of educational preparation having effect solely on the qualification of educational personnel within that State.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2.\u00a0 To the extent that contracts made pursuant to this Agreement deal with the educational requirements for the proper qualification of educational personnel, acceptance of a program of educational preparation shall be in accordance with such procedures and requirements as may be provided in the applicable contract.\nARTICLE V\nINTERSTATE COOPERATION\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The party States agree

notice in writing of the withdrawal to the Governors of all other party States.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3.\u00a0 No withdrawal shall relieve the withdrawing State of any obligation imposed upon it by a contract to which it is a party.\u00a0 The duration of contracts and the methods and conditions of withdrawal therefrom shall be those specified in their terms.\n\u00a0\nARTICLE IX\nCONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Agreement shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof.\u00a0 The provisions of this Agreement shall be severable and
