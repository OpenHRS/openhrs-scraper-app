compacting states rejects a rule by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt this compact, then such rule shall have no further force and effect in any compacting

promulgated rules.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b)\u00a0 Default, technical assistance, suspension, and termination.\u00a0 If the interstate commission determines that a member state has defaulted in

notice to the defaulting state and other member states, of the nature of the default, the means of curing the default, and any action taken by the interstate commission.\u00a0 The interstate commission shall specify the conditions by which the defaulting state must cure its default; and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (c)\u00a0 If the defaulting state fails to cure the default, the defaulting state shall be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the member states and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by this compact shall be terminated from the effective date of termination.\u00a0 A cure of the default shall not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of the default.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (d)\u00a0 Suspension or termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted.\u00a0 Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the interstate commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and each of the member states.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (e)\u00a0 The state which has been suspended or terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of suspension or termination including obligations, the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of suspension or termination.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (f)\u00a0 The interstate commission shall not bear any costs relating to any state that has been found to be in default or which has been suspended or terminated from the compact, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing between the interstate commission and the defaulting state.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (g)\u00a0 The defaulting state may appeal the action of the interstate commission by petitioning the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the interstate commission has its [principal] offices.\u00a0 The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorney's fees.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (h)\u00a0 Dispute

among member states and between member and non-member states; and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 The interstate commission shall promulgate rules providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (i)\u00a0 Enforcement:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 The interstate commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of this compact;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 The interstate commission may, by majority vote of the members, initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or, at the discretion of the interstate commission, in the federal district where the interstate commission has its [principal] offices, to enforce compliance with the provisions of this compact, its promulgated rules and bylaws, against a member state in default.\u00a0 The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages.\u00a0 In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees; and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (3)\u00a0 The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the interstate commission.\u00a0 The interstate commission may avail itself of any other remedies available under state law or the regulation of a profession.\n\u00a0\nARTICLE XIV\nFINANCING OF THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (a)\u00a0 The interstate commission shall pay, or provide for the payment of, the reasonable expenses of its establishment, organization, and ongoing activities.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b)\u00a0 The interstate commission may levy on and collect an annual assessment from each
