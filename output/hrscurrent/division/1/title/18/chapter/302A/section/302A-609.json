[L 1996, c 89, pt of \u00a72]\n\u00a0\nAttorney General Opinions\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Bargained for random drug testing program for public school teachers with appropriate procedural protections is constitutional and would not violate either the federal or state Constitution.\u00a0 If a court were to find such a program to violate either the federal or state Constitution, the doctrine of qualified immunity would bar personal liability for any state official; if a court were to impose personal liability, based upon past history and practice, the legislature would fund payment of the claims.\u00a0 Att. Gen. Op. 08-1."
