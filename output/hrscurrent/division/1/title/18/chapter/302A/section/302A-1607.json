following factors:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 For new school construction, the cost per student for each school type (elementary, middle or intermediate, and high school) shall be based on the ten-year average construction of a new school facility using the Honolulu assessment district in 2006 as the base.\u00a0 Costs for construction completed earlier than 2006 shall be escalated to 2006 using the engineering news-record construction cost index;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 For expansion of existing school facilities, the cost per student for each school type (elementary, middle or intermediate, and high school) is based on the ten-year average construction of whatever components are required to expand the school using the Honolulu assessment district in 2006 as the base;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (3)\u00a0 The cost per student in other assessment districts shall be the cost per student in the Honolulu assessment district multiplied by the appropriate cost factor in subsection (d).\u00a0 At least every three years, the department shall update the cost per student based on the construction of a new permanent school facility, and present the written analysis to the board for review; and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (4)\u00a0 Student generation rates, as defined in section 302A-1602.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b)\u00a0 The student generation rate for each school type (elementary, middle or intermediate, and high school) shall be multiplied by the cost per student for each school type (elementary, middle or intermediate, and high school) to determine the cost per dwelling unit in the development.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (c)\u00a0 The construction cost component impact fee shall be based on recent public school construction costs.\u00a0 The 1997 to 2007 period school construction costs per student, adjusted for both the year 2007 and for the Honolulu assessment district, are as follows:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 Elementary schools:\u00a0 $35,357 per student;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 Middle and intermediate schools:\u00a0 $36,097 per student; and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (3)\u00a0 High schools:\u00a0 $64,780 per student.\nThe costs per student for other assessment districts shall be determined by multiplying the Honolulu assessment district costs per student by the applicable cost factor in subsection (d).\u00a0 These costs per student shall be updated at least every three years, pursuant to the provisions in section 302A-1612.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (d)\u00a0 The State shall be divided into the following twenty-six geographically limited cost districts, and the cost factors listed for each cost district shall be applied to the calculation of school construction costs per unit pursuant to subsection (c):\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cost District\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 School
