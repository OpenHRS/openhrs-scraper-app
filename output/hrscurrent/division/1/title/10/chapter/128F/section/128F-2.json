provided that it is understood that the state rendering aid may withhold resources to the extent necessary to provide reasonable protection for such state.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Each party state shall afford to the emergency forces of any party state, while operating within its state limits under the terms and conditions of this compact, the same powers (except that of arrest unless specifically authorized by the receiving state), duties, rights, and privileges as are afforded forces of the state in which they are performing emergency services.\u00a0 Emergency forces will continue under the command and control of their regular leaders, but the organizational units will come under the operational control of the emergency services authorities of the state receiving assistance.\u00a0 These conditions may be activated, as needed, only subsequent to a declaration of a state of emergency or disaster by the governor of the party state that is to receive assistance or upon commencement of exercises or training for mutual aid and shall continue so long as the exercises or training for mutual aid are in progress, the state of emergency or disaster remains in effect or loaned resources remain in the receiving states, whichever is longer.\n\u00a0\nARTICLE V.\u00a0 LICENSES AND PERMITS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Whenever any person holds a license, certificate, or other permit issued by any state party to the compact evidencing the meeting of qualifications for professional, mechanical, or other skills, and when such assistance is requested by the receiving party state, such person shall be deemed licensed, certified, or permitted by the state requesting assistance to render aid involving such skill to meet a declared emergency or disaster, subject to such limitations and conditions as the governor of the requesting state may prescribe by executive order or otherwise.\n\u00a0\nARTICLE VI.\u00a0 LIABILITY\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Officers or employees of a party state rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact shall be considered agents of the requesting state for tort liability and immunity purposes.\u00a0 No party state or its officers or employees rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact shall be liable on account of any act or omission in good faith on the part of such forces while so engaged or on account of the maintenance or use of any equipment or supplies in connection therewith.\u00a0 Good faith in this article shall not include willful misconduct, gross negligence, or recklessness.\n\u00a0\nARTICLE VII.\u00a0 SUPPLEMENTARY AGREEMENTS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Inasmuch as it is probable that the pattern and detail of the machinery for mutual aid among two or more states may differ from that among the states that are party hereto, this compact contains elements of a broad base common to all states, and nothing contained in this compact shall preclude any state from entering into supplementary agreements with another state or affect any other agreements already in force between states.\u00a0 Supplementary agreements may comprehend, but shall not be limited to, provisions for evacuation and reception of injured and other persons and the exchange of medical, fire, police, public utility, reconnaissance, welfare, transportation and communications personnel, and equipment and supplies.\n\u00a0\nARTICLE VIII.\u00a0 COMPENSATION\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Each party state shall provide for the payment of compensation and death benefits to injured members of the emergency forces of that state and representatives of deceased members of such forces in case such members sustain injuries or are killed while rendering aid pursuant to this compact, in the same manner and on the same terms as if the injury or death were sustained within their own state.\n\u00a0\nARTICLE IX.\u00a0 REIMBURSEMENT\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Any party state rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact shall be reimbursed by the party state receiving such aid for any loss or damage to or expense incurred in the operation of any equipment and the provision of any service in answering a request for aid and for the costs incurred in connection with such requests;
