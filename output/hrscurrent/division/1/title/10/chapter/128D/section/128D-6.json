another party or entity and containing such hazardous substances; and \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (4)\u00a0 Any person who accepts or accepted any hazardous substances for transport to disposal or treatment facilities or sites selected by such person, from which there is a release, or a threatened release, which causes the incurrence of response costs of a hazardous substance;\nshall be strictly liable for (A) all costs of removal or remedial actions incurred by the State or any other person; to the extent such costs and actions are consistent with this chapter, the state contingency plan, and any other state rules; (B) damages for injury to, destruction of, or loss of natural resources, including the reasonable costs of assessing such injury, destruction, or loss resulting from such release; and (C) the costs of any health assessment or health effects study carried out consistent with this chapter, the state contingency plan, or any other state

unpaid balance of the amounts recoverable under this section shall be the same rate as is specified for interest on investments of the State's fund.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (c)\u00a0 There shall be no liability under subsection (a) for a defendant otherwise liable who can establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the release or threat of release of a hazardous substance and the damages resulting therefrom were caused solely by:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 Any unanticipated grave natural disaster or other natural phenomenon of an exceptional, inevitable, and irresistible character, the effect of which could not have been prevented or avoided by the exercise of due care or foresight;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 An act of war;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (3)\u00a0 An act or omission of a third party other than an employee or agent of the defendant, or than one whose act or omission occurs in connection with a contractual relationship, existing directly or indirectly, with the defendant, if the defendant establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant exercised due care with respect to the hazardous substance concerned, taking into consideration the characteristics of such hazardous substance, in light of all relevant facts and circumstances; and the defendant took precautions against foreseeable acts or omissions of any such third party and the consequences that could foreseeably result from such acts or omissions; or\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (d) A defendant may also avoid liability under subsection (a) where the defendant is able to establish that the real property on which the facility concerned is located was acquired by the defendant after the disposal or placement of the hazardous substance on, in, or at the facility.\u00a0 In addition to establishing the foregoing, the defendant shall establish that the defendant has satisfied the requirements of section 128D-6(c)(3) and one or more of the following circumstances described in paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (4), or (5) is also established by the defendant by a preponderance of the evidence:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 At the time the defendant acquired the facility, the defendant did not know and had no reason to know that any hazardous substance which is the subject of the release or threatened release was disposed on, in, or at the facility;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 The defendant is a government entity that acquired the facility by escheat, through any other involuntary transfer or acquisition, or through the exercise of eminent domain authority by purchase or condemnation;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (3)\u00a0 The defendant acquired the facility by inheritance or bequest;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (4)\u00a0 At the

as described in subsection (k).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To establish that the defendant had no reason to know, as provided in paragraph (1), the defendant shall have undertaken, at the time of acquisition, all appropriate inquiry into the previous ownership and uses of the property consistent with good commercial or customary practice in an effort to minimize liability.\u00a0 For purposes of the preceding sentence, the environmental court shall take into account any specialized knowledge or experience on the part of the defendant, the relationship of the purchase price to the value of the property if uncontaminated, commonly known or reasonably ascertainable information about the property, the obviousness of the presence or likely presence of contamination at the property, and the ability to detect such contamination by appropriate inspection.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nothing in this subsection or in section 128D-6(c)(3) shall diminish the liability of any previous owner or operator of such facility who would otherwise be liable under this chapter.\u00a0 Notwithstanding this definition, if the defendant obtained actual knowledge of the release or threatened release of a hazardous substance at such facility when the defendant owned the real property and then subsequently transferred ownership of the property to another person without disclosing such knowledge, the defendant shall be treated as liable under section 128D-6(a)(1) and no defense under section 128D-6(c)(3) shall be available to the defendant.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nothing in this subsection shall affect the liability under this chapter of a defendant who, by any act or omission, caused or contributed to the release or threatened release of a hazardous substance which is the subject of the action relating to the facility.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (e)\u00a0 No person shall be liable under this chapter or otherwise under the laws of the State or any of the counties, including the

chapter, the National Contingency Plan, or at the direction of a federal or state on-scene coordinator, with respect to an incident creating a danger to public health or welfare or the environment as a result of any release of a hazardous substance or pollutant or contaminant or the threat thereof.\u00a0 This subsection shall not preclude liability for costs, damages, or penalties as the result of gross negligence or intentional misconduct on the part of such person.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (f)\u00a0 No county or local government shall be liable under this chapter for costs or damages as a result of actions taken in response to an emergency created by the release or threatened release of a hazardous substance or pollutant or contaminant generated by or from a facility owned by another person.\u00a0 This subsection shall not preclude liability for costs or damages as a result of gross negligence or intentional misconduct by the county or local government.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (g)\u00a0 No indemnification, hold harmless, or similar agreement or conveyances shall be effective to transfer from the owner or operator of any vessel or facility or from any person who may be liable for a release or threat of release under this section, to any other person, the liability imposed under this section.\u00a0 Nothing in this subsection shall bar any agreement to insure, hold harmless, or indemnify a party to such agreement for any liability under this section.\u00a0 Nothing in this chapter shall bar a cause of action that an owner or operator or any person subject to liability under this section, or a guarantor, has or would have, by reason of subrogation or otherwise against any person.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (h)\u00a0 In the case of an injury to, destruction of, or loss of natural resources under section 128D-6(a)(4)(B), liability shall be solely to the State for natural resources within the State or belonging to, managed by, controlled by, or appertaining to the State.\u00a0 The natural resource trustee for the State shall act on behalf of the public as trustee of such natural resources to recover for such damages.\u00a0 Sums recovered by the natural resource trustee under section 128D-6(a)(4)(B) shall not be limited by the sums which can be used to restore or replace such resources.\u00a0 Any damages recovered by the state attorney general for damages to natural resources shall be deposited in the fund and credited to a special account for the purposes provided above.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (i)\u00a0 Provided that no liability shall be imposed under this chapter, where the party sought to be charged has demonstrated that the damages to natural resources complained of were specifically identified as an irreversible and irretrievable commitment of natural resources in an environmental impact statement, or other comparable environmental analysis, and the decision to grant a permit or license authorizes such commitment of natural resources, and the facility or project was otherwise operating within the terms of its permit or license.\u00a0 There shall be no double recovery under this chapter for natural resource damages, including the costs of damage assessment or restoration, rehabilitation, or acquisition for the same release and natural resources.\u00a0 Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, there shall be no recovery under this chapter for natural resource damages where such damages have occurred wholly before July 1, 1990.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (j)\u00a0 No person other than a government entity may recover costs or damages under this chapter arising from a release which occurred before July 1, 1990.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (k)\u00a0 Contiguous properties shall be

that is or may be contaminated by a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance from, real property that is not owned by that person shall not be considered to be an owner or operator of a vessel or facility under section 128D-6(a) solely by reason of the contamination if:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (i)\u00a0 The person did not
