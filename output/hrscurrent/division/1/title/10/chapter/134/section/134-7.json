Rev. 575.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Defendant police chief was entitled to qualified immunity from plaintiff firearm permit applicant's 42 U.S.C. \u00a71983 claims for monetary damages for alleged violations of plaintiff's Second Amendment right to bear arms and Fourteenth Amendment procedural due process right because a reasonable official in defendant's circumstances would not have understood that defendant's conduct violated a right that was clearly established at the time of the denial of plaintiff's permit; this section, on which the denial was based, had not been invalidated by case or legislative action.\u00a0 869 F. Supp. 2d 1203 (2012).\n\u00a0 Plaintiff firearm permit applicant's allegations that plaintiff was denied a permit and ordered to surrender plaintiff's weapons due to a conviction of harassment under \u00a7711-1106 more than ten years before and that the conviction was not a crime of violence under subsection (b) or federal law for the purposes of prohibiting ownership or possession of firearms were sufficient to state a 42 U.S.C. \u00a71983 claim for a violation of plaintiff's Second Amendment rights.\u00a0 869 F. Supp. 2d 1203 (2012).\n\u00a0 Genuine issue of material fact existed regarding:\u00a0 (1) whether plaintiff had been under counseling for addiction to, abuse of, or dependence upon a drug or intoxicating liquor; and (2) whether plaintiff had been \"medically documented to be no longer adversely affected\" by drugs or intoxicating liquor.\u00a0 As a result, plaintiff had not established a Second Amendment right to possess firearms. 976 F. Supp. 2d 1200 (2013).\n\u00a0\u00a0Subsection (b) did not disqualify plaintiff from exercising plaintiff's Second Amendment rights because the court could not conclude that plaintiff's convictions for harassment constituted a crime of violence.\u00a0 976 F. Supp. 2d 1200 (2013).\n\u00a0 Where defendants argued that plaintiff was prohibited from possessing firearms under federal law because of the federal Lautenberg Amendment, which prohibits firearm ownership by any person who \"has been convicted in any court of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\", plaintiff's convictions for harassment did not qualify as a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence under federal law.\u00a0 976 F. Supp. 2d 1200 (2013).\n\u00a0 Felon convicted of possessing firearm properly sentenced under this section instead of \u00a7706-610.\u00a0 68 H. 622, 725 P.2d 799.\n\u00a0 Defendant exercised control when defendant sold gun.\u00a0 70 H. 219, 768 P.2d 230.\n\u00a0 Previously convicted felon must have intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly possessed or controlled the firearm.\u00a0 70 H. 509, 778 P.2d 704.\n\u00a0 Defendant may not assert the invalidity of the prior conviction as a defense under this section.\u00a0 71 H. 101, 784 P.2d 872.\n\u00a0 Convicted person may not assert the invalidity of the prior offense as a defense to this section.\u00a0 71 H. 111, 784 P.2d 873.\n\u00a0 Subsection (b) applies to felons who are convicted through a nolo contendere plea.\u00a0 83 H. 507, 928 P.2d 1.\n\u00a0 Where defendant's convictions were premised upon the use of \"any firearm\" and language of indictments and trial court's instructions \"to wit, a semiautomatic pistol\" did not alter the statutory elements of \u00a7\u00a7708-840, 134-6, or this section, trial court's error of not providing definition of \"semiautomatic firearm\" did not warrant reversal of convictions of first degree robbery, carrying or use of firearm in commission of separate felony, or felon in possession of firearm.\u00a0 91 H. 33, 979 P.2d 1059.\n\u00a0 For the purposes of subsection (b), \"possession\" must be analyzed using a two-pronged analysis: (1) the voluntary act of \"possession\" of an object \"itself\" is, by way of \u00a7702-202, satisfied where an individual acts knowingly with respect to his or her conduct; and (2) the requisite state of mind with respect to the attendant circumstances--i.e., the particular qualities of the object that make it illegal to possess it--is, by way of \u00a7702-204, satisfied by a reckless state of mind.\u00a0 93 H. 87, 997 P.2d 13.\n\u00a0 Where one bag containing a gun was found on truck seat next to defendant and another bag with two guns was found on truck floor where defendant had been sitting, jury could have inferred from totality of circumstances that defendant had the state of mind requisite to commit possession of a firearm and/or ammunition by a person convicted of certain crimes.\u00a0 93 H. 87, 997 P.2d 13.\n\u00a0 A person commits the offense of attempted prohibited possession of a firearm, pursuant to \u00a7705-500(1)(b) and (3), and subsection (b), if he or she intentionally engages in conduct that, under the circumstances as he or she believes them to be, constitutes a substantial step in a course of conduct intended to culminate in his or her commission of the offense of prohibited possession of a firearm.\u00a0 93 H. 199, 998 P.2d 479.\n\u00a0 As the offense of attempted prohibited possession of a firearm under this section does not include a result-of-conduct element and \u00a7705-500(2) does not therefore apply, trial court instruction erroneously defined the state of mind necessary to prove the offense of attempted prohibited possession of a firearm as something less than intentional, as required by \u00a7705-500(1)(b).\u00a0 93 H. 199, 998 P.2d 479.\n\u00a0 Pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7701-109(4)(b), 705-500(1)(b) and (3), and subsection (b), attempted prohibited possession of a firearm is an included offense of prohibited possession of a firearm.\u00a0 93 H. 199, 998 P.2d 479.\n\u00a0 Where defendant failed to carry defendant's burden of establishing that defendant's conduct--of possessing ammunition in violation of subsection (b), a class B felony involving conduct that had the potential for serious public safety consequences--was de minimis within the meaning of \u00a7702-236, appellate court's dismissal of trial court's granting of motion to dismiss charges as a de minimis infraction under \u00a7702-236 affirmed.\u00a0 123 H. 329, 235 P.3d 325.\n\u00a0 Requisite state of mind for a violation of subsection (b) is that of acting intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly; failure to instruct jury on state of mind element, as required by \u00a7701-114(1)(b), was prejudicial and not harmless error.\u00a0 78 H. 422 (App.), 895 P.2d 173.\n\u00a0 Where the State's evidence only went so far as to show defendant's ownership and presence in the vehicle and defendant's proximity to the firearm and ammunition, absent evidence of intent, the circuit court correctly granted defendant's renewed motion of judgment of acquittal; the appeals court thus erred in vacating circuit court's judgment by concluding that there was sufficient evidence of intent for jury to infer that defendant constructively possessed the subject rifle and ammunition in violation of subsection (b).\u00a0 128 H. 18, 282 P.3d 560 (2012).\n\u00a0 Where State failed to establish defendant's prior felony conviction and no lesser included offense of a felon in possession of a firearm or ammunition in chapter 134, defendant's convictions of being a felon in possession of a firearm and firearm ammunition under subsection (b) reversed.\u00a0 82 H. 517 (App.), 923 P.2d 934.\n\u00a0 Under subsection (b), multiple punishments are not authorized for violating the prohibition against possession of \"any firearm or ammunition therefor\"; thus, where defendant was already convicted of possessing a firearm, defendant could not be convicted for possession of ammunition loaded into that firearm.\u00a0 89 H. 59 (App.), 968 P.2d 1070.\n\u00a0 Although evidence that defendant had previously been convicted of a felony was relevant for purposes of this section, evidence that defendant may have received ineffective assistance of counsel during that prior felony trial would not have any bearing on the validity of that felony conviction; thus, trial court did not err in precluding evidence that defendant may have received ineffective assistance during prior trial.\u00a0 90 H. 489 (App.), 979 P.2d 85.\n\u00a0 Unless expressly permitted by the court, subsection (f) unqualifiedly prohibits a person subject to a chapter 586 order from possession and control of a firearm during the pendency of that order; this prohibition is effective irrespective of whether the respondent owned the firearms involved.\u00a0 91 H. 438 (App.), 984 P.2d 1264.\n\u00a0 Trial court erred in sentencing defendant to ten years of incarceration with a mandatory minimum term of ten years under \u00a7706-660.1(3)(c) as convicting defendant of being a felon in possession of a firearm pursuant to subsection (b) and sentencing defendant to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment pursuant to \u00a7706-660.1(3)(c) essentially punished defendant twice for a single possession of a firearm; a rational interpretation of \u00a7706-660.1 is that the legislature did not intend its application for felonies where the entirety of the felonious conduct is the use or possession of a firearm.\u00a0 107 H. 273 (App.), 112 P.3d 759.\n\u00a0 In a prosecution of a felon under subsection (b) for possession of firearm ammunition, the State must prove, whether by direct or circumstantial evidence, that the ammunition was \"actually loaded\"; given detective's authoritative identification of the bullets as ammunition, and in the absence of evidence that the ammunition was not loaded or otherwise incapable of being fired, was substantial evidence that the ammunition was actually loaded.\u00a0 108 H. 124 (App.), 117 P.3d 856.\n\u00a0 Mentioned:\u00a0 9 H. App. 333, 839 P.2d 1186."
