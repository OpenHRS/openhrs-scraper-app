[L 1976, c 104, pt of \u00a72; am L 1990, c 306, \u00a710; am L 2003, c 104, \u00a74; am L 2014, c 218, \u00a78]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Where (1) plaintiff had a legitimate interest in the iwi found in Kakaako because plaintiff was a recognized cultural descendant of those iwi, and (2) the rail project had a high likelihood of affecting the iwi, those general factual allegations of injury resulting from defendant's conduct were sufficient to establish that plaintiff had suffered an actual or threatened irreparable injury under subsection (b).\u00a0 128 H. 53, 283 P.3d 60 (2012).\n\u00a0 Because:\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 subsection (b) allows a suit to be brought only for a restraining order or injunctive relief and is an exception to the sovereign immunity doctrine for which no waiver is necessary, and therefore does not contain a waiver of the State's sovereign immunity; and (2) \u00a0nothing in article XI, \u00a79 of the Hawaii constitution expressly waived the State's immunity for attorney's fees, there was no clear relinquishment of the State's sovereign immunity, and thus, the State's immunity barred petitioner's request for fees based on the private attorney doctrine.\u00a0 129 H. 454, 304 P.3d 252 (2013).\n\u00a0 Where plaintiff asserted that: (1) plaintiff had family members buried on the church grounds; (2) plaintiff was a native Hawaiian and a recognized cultural descendant of the iwi found on the church grounds; (3) plaintiff had a traditional and customary practice of caring for iwi; (4) plaintiff was concerned that family members may be buried in unmarked burials on the church grounds; and (5) the disturbance of unmarked burials of family members or other cultural ancestors would cause plaintiff injury and harm, plaintiff had standing to raise claims under this chapter.\u00a0 128 H. 455 (App.), 290 P.3d 525 (2012)."
