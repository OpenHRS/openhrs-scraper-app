Supp. 559.\n\u00a0 Plaintiff's claims of reserved rights of native tenants under Hawaii law did not extend to the right of perpetual and exclusive occupancy upon the land of another; plaintiff's ancestors' failure to claim kuleana title to subject land, which rendered them tenants at sufferance, foreclosed plaintiff's attempt to claim possessory rights to the land under Hawaii law.\u00a0 875 F. Supp. 680.\n\u00a0 Rights afforded by this section did not inure to plaintiffs, nonresidents of the State; because ordinance instituting a $3 fee for nonresidents seeking entry to bay designated a marine life conservation district and nature preserve imposed a fee on nonresidents only, the ordinance did not contravene this section.\u00a0 215 F. Supp. 2d 1098.\n\u00a0 Rights of people before allodial titles granted. \u00a02 H. 87; 49 H. 456, 468, 421 P.2d 550.\n\u00a0 Right to water for domestic use under this statute.\u00a0 24 H. 47, 67, overruled on another point 31 H. 376.\n\u00a0 Applied in upholding ancient right of way.\u00a0 50 H. 298, 440 P.2d 95.\n\u00a0 Provision reserving to property owners the \"right to drinking water and running water\" deemed a codification of doctrine of riparian rights.\u00a0 54 H. 174, 504 P.2d 1330.\n\u00a0 Interpretation in 54 H. 174 continues to be appropriate and proper.\u00a0 65 H. 531, 656 P.2d 57.\n\u00a0 Riparian water rights created by section were not intended to be, and cannot be, severed from the land in any fashion.\u00a0 65 H. 531, 656 P.2d 57.\n\u00a0 Gathering rights of section interpreted to assure that lawful occupants of an ahupua\u0091a may, for the purposes of practicing native Hawaiian customs and traditions, enter underdeveloped lands within ahupua\u0091a to gather items enumerated in the statute. Gathering rights did not accrue to person who did not reside within ahupua\u0091a.\u00a0 66 H. 1, 656 P.2d 745; 73 H. 578, 837 P.2d 1247.\n\u00a0 If property is deemed \"fully developed\", i.e., lands zoned and used for residential purposes with existing dwellings, improvements, and infrastructure, it is always \"inconsistent\" to permit the practice of traditional and customary native Hawaiian rights on such property.\u00a0 89 H. 177, 970 P.2d 485.\n\u00a0 To establish the existence of a traditional or customary native Hawaiian practice, there must be an adequate foundation in the record connecting the claimed right to a firmly rooted traditional or customary native Hawaiian practice.\u00a0 89 H. 177, 970 P.2d 485.\n\u00a0 Where defendant failed to adduce sufficient evidence to support claim of the exercise of a constitutionally protected native Hawaiian right and knowingly entered landowner's property which was fenced in a manner to exclude others, trial court properly concluded that defendant was unlawfully on property in violation of \u00a7708-814(1).\u00a0 89 H. 177, 970 P.2d 485.\n\u00a0 Trial court erred in granting defendant's motion for summary judgment where there existed a genuine issue of material fact as to the ancient or historic use of the subject trail.\u00a0 104 H. 43, 85 P.3d 150.\n\u00a0 Right of way easement was limited to ingress and egress and did not include right to park.\u00a0 1 H. App. 263, 618 P.2d 312.\n\u00a0 No showing of right-of-way of necessity.\u00a0 2 H. App. 663, 639 P.2d 420.\n\u00a0 Standards for granting an easement by necessity.\u00a0 3 H. App. 136, 642 P.2d 549.\n\u00a0 Where the district court made no factual findings that defendant or any of defendant's family members lawfully resided, owned, or occupied land in Kalalau Valley, and defendant's testimony that defendant's paternal great grandmother's family line was in some way connected with a family named Kupihea who once owned a kuleana lot in Kalalau was not sufficient to establish defendant's entitlement to the rights reserved to native Hawaiian ahupua\u0091a residents under this section, defendant did not meet defendant's burden of establishing defendant's rights in Kalalau Valley pursuant to this section.\u00a0 124 H. 329 (App.), 243 P.3d 289 (2010).\n\u00a0 Referred to:\u00a0 6 H. 334, 336; 20 H. 658, 667."
