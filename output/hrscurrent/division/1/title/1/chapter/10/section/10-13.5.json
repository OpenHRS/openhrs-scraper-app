[L 1980, c 273, \u00a71; am L 1990, c 304, \u00a7\u00a77, 16]\n\u00a0\nAttorney General Opinions\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Legislature must again determine which income and proceeds from the public land trust lands are to go to the office of Hawaiian affairs (OHA).\u00a0\u00a0 Until legislature reestablishes a funding mechanism for OHA, Executive Order No. 03-03 is the only mechanism in place for transferring receipts from the use of ceded lands to OHA; receipts from the sale or transfer of biogenetic resources do not qualify for transfer under the order.\u00a0 Att. Gen. Op. 03-3.\n\u00a0 Receipts derived from ceded lands apportioned for native Hawaiians pursuant to article XII, \u00a76 of the state constitution and this section may be transmitted directly to office of Hawaiian affairs by agencies that collect them, without legislative appropriation.\u00a0 Att. Gen. Op. 03-4.\n\u00a0\nLaw Journals and Reviews\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 The Lum Court and Native Hawaiian Rights.\u00a0 14 UH L.

L. No. 105-66, \u00a7340, 111 Stat. at 1448), leaving court with no judicially manageable standards to determine whether office of Hawaiian affairs was entitled to the specific revenues sought in the suit.\u00a0 96 H. 388, 31 P.3d 901."
