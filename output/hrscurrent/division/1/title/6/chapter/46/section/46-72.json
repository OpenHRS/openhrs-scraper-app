[L 1943, c 181, \u00a71; RL 1945, \u00a76013; RL 1955, \u00a7138-21; HRS \u00a746-72; am L 1998, c 124, \u00a71; am L 2007, c 152, \u00a78]\n\u00a0\nCross References\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Use, repair, and maintenance of public roads in ownership dispute, see \u00a746-15.9.\n\u00a0\nLaw Journals and Reviews\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 The Requirement for Notice of Claim Against the City and County of Honolulu:\u00a0 Does it Apply to a Claim for Contribution Under the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act?\u00a0 3 HBJ, May 1965, at 4.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Presentation of claim against county within six month limit was not condition precedent to maintaining third party action against county for contribution under Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act.\u00a0 283 F. Supp. 854.\n\u00a0 This is a statute of limitations and is to be narrowly construed.\u00a0 283 F. Supp. 854.\n\u00a0 Plaintiff's [chapters] 368 and 378 state law claims against the county were time-barred under this section, where plaintiff never provided the county written notice of plaintiff's claim.\u00a0 504 F. Supp. 2d 969.\n\u00a0 Sufficiency of notice of claim discussed.\u00a0 54 H. 210, 505 P.2d 1182.\n\u00a0 Notice of claim requirement is inconsistent with \u00a7662-4 and is invalid.\u00a0 55 H. 216, 517 P.2d 51; 56 H. 135, 531 P.2d 648.\n\u00a0 Because the city is neither the sovereign nor the surrogate or alter ego of the sovereign, it is not entitled to sovereign immunity; thus, it is subject to the State's tort laws in the same manner as any private tortfeasor; as \u00a7657-13 governs classes of \"personal\" tort actions, such as \"damage to persons or property\", the infancy tolling provision of \u00a7657-13(1) applies directly to personal injury actions against the city; child was thus able to bring action, but as \u00a7657-13(1) did not provide for tolling of parents' derivative actions and they did not timely comply with this section, their individual claims were barred.\u00a0 104 H. 341, 90 P.3d 233.\n\u00a0 Counties do not fall within the ambit of the State Tort Liability Act, chapter 662; this section is the statute of limitations applicable to actions against the counties.\u00a0 104 H. 341, 90 P.3d 233.\n\u00a0 The limitation period set forth in this section is not tolled pending the appointment of a personal representative.\u00a0 115 H. 1, 165 P.3d 247.\n\u00a0 The statute of limitations applicable to the estate's claims arising out of decedent's injuries and the plaintiff's own derivative wrongful death damages was this section; this section applies to claims against counties arising from fatal injuries.\u00a0 115 H. 1, 165 P.3d 247.\n\u00a0 Where this section (2006) created a class of tort claimants, injured by the conduct of a county, who were subject to a six-month statute of limitations period for filing their complaint, and victims of injuries caused by the State under \u00a7662-4 had a two-year limitation period, and there was no rational basis to support such disparate treatment, this section (2006) was unconstitutional under article I, \u00a75 of the Hawaii constitution.\u00a0 115 H. 1, 165 P.3d 247."
