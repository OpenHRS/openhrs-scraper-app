Supp. 2d 1156 (2013).\n\u00a0 Where county officials assured developer that developer's plans met zoning requirements and developer expended substantial sum in reliance, the city was estopped from denying developer a building permit under a subsequently enacted ordinance.\u00a0 60 H. 446, 592 P.2d 26.\n\u00a0 Section does not relate to a city's executive, legislative and administrative structure and organization; zoning by initiative is impermissible.\u00a0 70 H. 480, 777 P.2d 244.\n\u00a0 Public utilities commission has the authority to regulate the height of utility poles.\u00a0 72 H. 285, 814 P.2d 398.\n\u00a0 As state water code expressly reserves the counties' authority with respect to land use planning and policy, water resource management commission allegedly imposing a \"directive\" on the counties to designate priorities among proposed uses did not usurp counties' land use planning and zoning authority.\u00a0 94 H. 97, 9 P.3d 409.\n\u00a0 Rezoning is a legislative function; a zoning ordinance is a legislative act and is subject to the deference given legislative acts.\u00a0 102 H. 465, 78 P.3d 1.\n\u00a0 Where department of planning and permitting director's mixed finding of fact and conclusion of law that a change in nonconforming use was permitted under the land use ordinance was not supported by the record, the appeals court erred when it concluded that the director's ruling \"was reasonably based on the evidence before the director and constituted a reasonable application of the applicable zoning ordinance and the department's previous interpretation of that ordinance\".\u00a0 121 H. 16, 211 P.3d 74.\u00a0 \n\u00a0 Grandfather protections afforded a property owner under this section and land use ordinance intended to prohibit new zoning ordinances from interfering with an owner's lawful uses of a building or premises under an existing zoning ordinance.\u00a0 86 H. 343 (App.), 949 P.2d 183.\n\u00a0 \"Lawful use\" and \"previously lawful\", as used in this section and land use ordinance, respectively, refer to compliance with previous zoning laws, not the building codes or other legal requirements that may be applicable to the construction or operation of a structure.\u00a0 86 H. 343 (App.), 949 P.2d 183.\n\u00a0 Subsection (a) establishes a private right of action in favor of a real estate owner directly affected by an alleged land use ordinance (LUO) zoning violation to seek judicial enforcement of the LUO; thus, the circuit court had original subject matter jurisdiction over plaintiffs\u0092 zoning enforcement claim; however, the circuit court\u0092s jurisdiction was subject to the doctrine of primary jurisdiction where the court was justified in requiring the plaintiffs to first pursue an administrative determination of their claim that defendants had been violating the LUO before proceeding with judicial enforcement of the LUO.\u00a0 127 H. 390 (App.), 279 P.3d 55 (2012).\n\u00a0 Public trust duties under article XI, \u00a71 of the Hawaii constitution extended to appellee Kauai County planning commission's review of appellant water bottling company's existing and proposed use of water for its operations; the county's public trust duty under article XI, \u00a71 coupled with the State's power to create and delegate duties and responsibilities to the various counties through the enactment of statutes, established that the county had a duty to conserve and protect water in considering whether to issue a use permit and zoning permit to appellant.\u00a0 130 H. 407 (App.), 312 P.3d 283 (2013)."
