For statute of limitations purposes, any such pleading shall relate back to the filing date of the complaint of the person who originally brought the action, to the extent that the claim of the county arises out of the conduct, transactions, or occurrences set forth, or attempted to be set forth, in the prior complaint of that person.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (c)\u00a0 If the county does not proceed with an action under this section, the person bringing the action or settling the claim shall receive an amount that the court decides is reasonable for collecting the civil penalty and damages.\u00a0 The amount shall be not less than twenty-five per cent and not more than thirty per cent of the proceeds of the action or settlement and shall be paid out of the proceeds.\u00a0 The person shall also receive an amount for reasonable expenses that the court finds to have been necessarily incurred, plus reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.\u00a0 All expenses, fees, and costs shall be awarded against the defendant.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (d)\u00a0 Regardless of whether the county proceeds with the action, if the court finds that the action was brought by a person who planned and initiated the violation of section 46-171 upon which the action was brought, then the court, to the extent the court considers appropriate, may reduce the share of the proceeds of the action that the person would otherwise receive under subsection (a), taking into account the role of that person in advancing the case to litigation and any relevant circumstances pertaining to the violation.\u00a0 If the person bringing the action is convicted of criminal conduct arising from the person's role in the violation of section 46-171, that person shall be dismissed from the civil action and shall not receive any share of the proceeds of the action.\u00a0 The dismissal shall not prejudice the right of the county to continue the action.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0(e)\u00a0 If the county does not proceed with the action and the person bringing the action conducts the action, the court may award to the defendant its reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses if the defendant prevails in the action and the court finds that the claim of the person bringing the action was frivolous, vexatious, or brought primarily for purposes of harassment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0(f)\u00a0 In no event may a person bring an action under section 46-175:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 Against any elected official of the county, if the action is based on evidence or information known to the county.\u00a0 For purposes of this section, evidence or information known only to the person or persons against whom an action is brought shall not be considered to be known to the county; or\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 That is based upon allegations or transactions that are the subject of a civil suit or an administrative civil money penalty proceeding in which the county is already a party.
