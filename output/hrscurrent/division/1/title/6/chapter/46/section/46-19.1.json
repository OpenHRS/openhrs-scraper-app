provided that any contract or agreement shall provide, in essence, that any amounts due and owing by the county under the contract or agreement on an annual basis shall be subject to annual appropriations by the county, and any obligation issued pursuant to the terms of the contract or agreement in the form of bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness shall arise only when moneys or securities have been irrevocably set aside for the full payment of a like principal amount of bonds issued pursuant to this section.\u00a0 The selection of entities to provide a support facility or to remarket bonds may be in such manner and upon such terms and conditions as the governing body shall approve by resolution.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b)\u00a0 If the governing body of the county shall find that the sale of a facility for the processing and disposal of solid waste, or generation of electric energy, or both will not deprive the county of the availability of the facility and will result in a reduction to the county of the costs of the facility, any law to the contrary notwithstanding, any county may sell a facility financed pursuant to this section at competitive or negotiated sale at such price and upon such terms and conditions as the governing body shall approve by resolution.\u00a0 The sale may be pursuant to an installment sales contract or such other form of agreement as the governing body shall approve by resolution.\u00a0 A facility sold as authorized by this subsection shall continue to constitute a public undertaking as provided in subsection (a), and the proceeds of such sale shall constitute revenues derived from the services and commodities furnished by the undertaking.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (c)\u00a0 A county may lease any facility sold as authorized by this section or enter into an operating agreement or other arrangement with the purchaser or a lessee of the purchaser of the facility upon such terms and conditions as the governing body shall approve by resolution.\u00a0 So long as a facility sold as authorized by this section is available to the county, notwithstanding that availability is conditioned on payment of reasonable fees for the services and commodities furnished thereby, the facility shall be deemed used for a public purpose and payment of the costs of construction shall constitute a purpose for which bonds may be issued as authorized by subsection (a).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (d)\u00a0 Insofar as this section is inconsistent with the provisions of any law or charter, this section shall control.\u00a0 The powers conferred by this section shall be in addition and supplemental to the powers conferred by any other law or charter, and bonds may be issued and a facility financed from the proceeds thereof may be sold as authorized by this section notwithstanding any debt or other limitation prescribed by any other law or charter.
