creation of community facilities districts to finance special improvements in the county.\u00a0 The special improvements may be provided and financed under the ordinance.\u00a0 The county shall have the power to levy and assess a special tax on property located in a district to finance the special improvements and to pay the debt service on any bonds issued to finance the special improvements.\u00a0 The county may issue and sell bonds to provide funds for the special improvements, or, if requested by the county, the State may issue and sell revenue bonds under section 201H-72.\u00a0 Bonds issued to provide funds for the special improvements may be either:\u00a0 bonds secured only by the properties included in the district and/or the special taxes thereon, or bonds payable from general taxes and/or secured by the general taxing power of the county.\u00a0 If the bonds are secured only by the properties included in the district and/or the special taxes thereon, the bonds shall be issued according and subject to the provisions of the ordinance.\u00a0 If the bonds are payable from general taxes or secured by the general taxing power, the bonds shall be issued

on the basis of special benefit to be conveyed on property by the special improvement, or that the special improvement convey a special benefit on any property in the district.\u00a0 It shall be sufficient that the governing body of the county determines that the property to be subject to the special tax is improved or benefited by the special improvement in a general manner or in any other manner.\u00a0 The special improvement may also benefit property outside the district.\u00a0 The special taxes assessed pursuant to this section shall be a lien upon the property assessed.\u00a0 The

to this section shall be on a parity with the lien of general real property taxes and the lien of assessments levied under section 46-80, except to the extent the law or assessment ordinance provides that the lien of assessments levied under section 46-80 shall be subordinate to the lien of general real property taxes.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (c)\u00a0 The ordinance shall describe the types of

fifty-five per cent of the affected owners of the property, in the community facilities district proposed to be subject to the special tax protest in writing at the hearing.\u00a0 The ordinance shall also provide that if a lease requires the lessee to pay the proposed special tax, the ordinance shall state that the affected owner may waive this requirement in writing and that the affected owner refrain from imposing upon any successor lessee the obligation to pay the special tax.\u00a0 The ordinance shall also provide that if the affected owner fails to waive the requirement that the lessee pay the proposed tax, then all the rights for notice, hearing, and protest contained in this paragraph shall inure to the benefit of the original lessee or any subsequent lessee;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (4)\u00a0 Provide notice to buyers or lessees of the property who would be required to pay the special tax;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (5)\u00a0 Fixing, levying,

changes in the community facilities district, in the special taxes, or in the special improvements to be financed or provided;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (7)\u00a0 The acquisition or construction of the special improvements;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (8)\u00a0 The issuance of bonds to pay all or part of the cost of the special improvements (including costs of issuance, reserves, capitalized interest, credit enhancement, and any other related expenses);\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (9)\u00a0 Refunding bonds previously issued;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (10)\u00a0 The establishment and handling of a

matters as the council shall determine to be necessary or proper.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The amount of special taxes may include amounts determined by the council to be necessary or reasonable to cover administration and collection of the assessments, administration of the bonds or of the program authorized by this section, replenishment of reserves, arbitrage rebate, and a reasonable financing fee.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (d)\u00a0 Each issue of bonds shall be authorized by ordinance, separate from the foregoing procedural ordinance, and shall be in such amounts, denominations,

This section is a special improvement statute which implements section 12 of article VII of the state constitution and provides a complete, additional, and alternative method of doing the things authorized herein; and the creation of districts, levying, assessments and collection of special taxes, issuance of bonds and other matters covered by this section, or by the procedural or bond ordinances authorized by this section, need not comply with any other law applicable to these matters.\u00a0 Bonds issued under this section, when the only security for such bonds is the special taxes or liens on the property in the district subject thereto, shall be excluded from any determination of the power of a county to issue general obligation bonds or funded debt for purposes of section 13 of article VII of the state constitution.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (f)\u00a0 Notwithstanding any other law, no action or proceeding to question the validity of or enjoining any ordinance, action, or proceeding undertaken pursuant hereto (including the determination of the amount of any special tax levied with respect to any property or the levy or assessment thereof), or any bonds issued or to be issued pursuant thereto or under this section, shall be maintained unless begun within thirty days of the adoption of the ordinance, determination, levy, assessment or other act, as the case may be, and, in the case of bonds, within thirty days after adoption of the ordinance authorizing the issuance of those bonds.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (g)\u00a0 Bonds issued pursuant to this section and the interest thereon and other income therefrom shall be exempt from any and all taxation by the State or any county or other political subdivision thereof, except inheritance, transfer, and estate taxes.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (h)\u00a0 Properties of entities of the state, federal, or county governments, except as provided in subsection (i), shall be exempt from the special tax.\u00a0 No other properties or entities are exempt from the special tax unless the properties or entities are expressly exempted in the ordinance of formation to establish a district adopted pursuant to this chapter or in an ordinance of consideration to levy a new special tax or special taxes or to alter the rate or method of apportionment of an existing special tax as provided in this section.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (i)\u00a0 If a public body owning property, including property held in trust for any beneficiary, which is exempt from a special tax pursuant to subsection (h), grants leasehold or other possessory interest in the property to a nonexempt person or entity, the special tax, notwithstanding subsection (h), shall be levied on the leasehold or possessory interest and shall be payable by the lessee.
