provided that the tax credit shall apply only to the actual cost of the solar or wind energy device, the heat pump, or ice storage system, their accessories, and installation and shall not include the cost of consumer incentive premiums unrelated to the operation of the solar or wind energy device, the heat pump, or ice storage system offered with the sale of the solar or wind energy device, the heat pump, or ice storage system.\u00a0 The credit shall be claimed against net income tax liability for the year in which the solar or wind energy device, the heat pump, or ice storage system was purchased and placed in use; provided:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 The tax credit shall be applicable only with respect to solar devices, which are erected and placed in service after December 31, 1974, but before January 1, 1990;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 In the case of wind energy devices and heat pumps, the tax credit shall be applicable only with respect to wind energy devices and heat pumps which are installed and placed in service after December 31, 1980, but before January 1, 1990;
