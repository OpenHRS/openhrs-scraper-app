provided that the term employer shall not include any government that is not subject to the laws of the State except as, and to the extent that, it consents to the application of sections 235-61 to 235-67 to it.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b)\u00a0 Every employer, as defined herein, making payment of wages, as herein defined, to employees, shall deduct and withhold from such wages an amount of tax determined as provided in this section.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (c)\u00a0 For each withholding period (whether weekly, biweekly, monthly, or otherwise) the amount of tax to be withheld under this section shall be at a rate which, for the taxable year, will yield the tax imposed by section 235-51 upon each employee's annual wage, as estimated from the employee's current wage in any withholding period, but for the purposes of this subsection of the rates provided by section 235-51 the maximum to be taken into consideration shall be eight per cent.\u00a0 The tax for the taxable year shall be calculated upon the following assumptions:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 That the employee's annual wage, as estimated from the employee's current wage in the withholding period, will be the employee's sole income for the taxable year;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 That there will be no deductions therefrom in determining adjusted gross income;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (3)\u00a0 That in determining taxable income there shall be a standard deduction allowance which shall be an amount equal to one exemption (or more than one exemption if so prescribed by the director) unless (A) the taxpayer is married and the taxpayer's spouse is an employee receiving wages subject to withholding, or (B) the taxpayer has withholding exemption certificates in effect with respect to more than one employer.\u00a0 For the purposes of this section, any standard deduction allowance under this paragraph shall be treated as if it were denominated a withholding exemption;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (4)\u00a0 That in determining taxable income there also will be deducted the amount of exemptions and withholding allowances granted to the employee in the computation of taxable income, as shown by a certificate to be filed with the employer as provided by subsection (f); and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (5)\u00a0 If it appears from the certificate filed pursuant to subsection (f) that the employee, under section 235-93, is entitled to make a joint return, that the employee and the employee's spouse will so elect.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (d)\u00a0 Alternatively, at the election of the employer, the employer may deduct and withhold from each employee an amount of tax determined on the basis of tables to be prepared and furnished by the department of taxation, which amount of tax shall be substantially equivalent to the amount of tax provided by subsection (c) hereof.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (e)\u00a0 The department, by rule, may require the deduction and withholding of tax from any remuneration or compensation paid for or attributable to services that are not subject to the general excise tax imposed by chapter 237, whether or not such withholding is provided for hereinabove.\u00a0 Every person so required to deduct and withhold tax, or from whom tax is required to be deducted and withheld, shall be subject to sections 235-61 to 235-67, and every person so required to deduct and withhold tax shall be deemed an employer for the purposes of this chapter.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The department, by rule, may exempt any employer from the requirement of deduction and withholding of taxes, even though the requirement is imposed by this section, if and to the extent that the department finds the requirement unduly onerous or impracticable of enforcement.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (f)\u00a0 On or before the date of the commencement of employment with an employer, the employee shall furnish the employer with a signed certificate relating to the number of exemptions which the employee claims, which shall in no event exceed the number to which the employee is entitled on the basis of the existing facts, and also showing whether the employee is married and is, under section 235-93, entitled to make a joint return.\u00a0 The certificate shall be in such form and contain such information as may be prescribed by the department.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If, on any day during the calendar year, there is a change in the employee's marital status and the employee no longer is entitled to make a joint return, or the number of exemptions to which the employee is entitled is less than the number of exemptions claimed by the employee on the certificate then in effect with respect to the employee, the employee shall within ten days thereafter furnish the employer with a new certificate showing the employee's present marital status, or relating to the number of exemptions which the employee then claims, which shall in no event exceed the number to which the employee is entitled on the basis of the existing facts.\u00a0 If, on any day during the calendar year, there is a change in the employee's marital status and though previously not entitled to make a joint return the employee now is so entitled, or the number of exemptions to which the employee is entitled is greater than the number of exemptions claimed, the employee may furnish the employer with a new certificate showing the employee's present marital status, or relating to the number of exemptions which the employee then claims, which shall in no event exceed the number to which the employee is entitled on the basis of the existing facts.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Such certificate shall take effect at the times set forth in the Internal Revenue Code.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (g)\u00a0 In determining the deduction allowed by subsection (c)(4) an employee shall be entitled to withholding allowances or additional reductions in withholding under this subsection.\u00a0 In determining the number of additional withholding allowances or the amount of additional reductions in withholding under this subsection, the employee may take into account (to the extent and in the manner provided by rules) estimated itemized deductions and tax credits allowable under this chapter; and such additional deductions and other items as may be specified by the director in rules.\u00a0 For the purposes of this subsection a fractional number shall not be taken into account unless it amounts to one-half or more, in which case it shall be increased to the next whole number.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 As used in this subsection, unless the context otherwise requires:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (A)\u00a0 \"Estimated itemized deductions\" means the aggregate amount which the employee reasonably expects will be allowed as deductions under sections 235-2.3, 235-2.4, 235-2.45, and 235-7, other than the deductions referred to in Internal Revenue Code section 151 and those deductions required to be taken into account in determining adjusted gross income under Internal Revenue Code section 62(a) (with the exception of paragraph 10 thereof) for the estimation year.\u00a0 In no case shall the aggregate amount be greater than the sum of:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (i)\u00a0 The amount of the deductions reflected in the employee's net income tax return for the taxable year preceding the estimation year of (if a return has not been filed for the preceding taxable year at the time the withholding exemption certificate is furnished the employer) the second taxable year preceding the estimation year;
