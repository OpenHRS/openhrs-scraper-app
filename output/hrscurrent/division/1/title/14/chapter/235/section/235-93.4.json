Gen. Op. 11-2.\n\u00a0 Definitions of \"marriage\" and \"spouse\" under the federal Defense of Marriage Act, Pub. L. No. 104-199, 110 Stat. 2419, may preclude civil union partners of the same gender under the State's Civil Union Act from filing jointly for federal income tax purposes, but they do not preclude civil union partners from filing joint tax returns for Hawaii income tax purposes.\u00a0 Att. Gen. Op. 11-2."
