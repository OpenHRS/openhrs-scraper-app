[L 2005, c 247, \u00a7\u00a75, 9]\n\u00a0\nAttorney General Opinions\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Because the legislature was within its authority to retain ten per cent of the county surcharge, even if the retained amount exceeds the actual costs of administering the surcharge, there is no conflict within Act 247, Session Laws of Hawaii 2005, and no requirement that the State retain less than the ten per cent specified in subsection (a).\u00a0 Att. Gen. Op. 15-1.\n\u00a0 The State's retention of any funds in excess of what is deemed necessary and proper to administer the surcharge does not violate either the equal protection clause or the due process clause of the United States Constitution or the Hawaii State Constitution.\u00a0 Att. Gen. Op. 15-1.\n\u00a0 The ten per cent deduction of the county surcharge for the costs of assessment, collection, and disposition of the county surcharge on state general excise tax into the state general fund is neither unconstitutional nor illegal.\u00a0 Att. Gen. Op. 15-1.\n\u00a0 The term \"shall\" in \"[T]he director of finance shall deduct ten per cent of the gross proceeds\" in subsection (a) is mandatory, not directory.\u00a0 Att. Gen. Op. 15-1."
