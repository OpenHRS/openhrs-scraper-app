was not in business during any part of the preceding year, the tax shall be at the rate provided by sections 239-5 and 239-6, except that there shall be no adjustment of the rate of tax on account of the ratio of the net income to the gross income being in excess of fifteen per cent and it shall be assumed for purposes of this subsection and subsection (e) that the ratio is fifteen per cent or less.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The estimate shall be made and the tax returned on or before the twentieth day of the third month after the month in which the company begins business and shall be

applies, any variance between the estimate and the actual gross income for that year shall be adjusted and a credit or refund made, or payment of additional tax due, depending upon whether the estimate was in excess of, or less than, the actual gross income of the company for that year.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If the year for which the estimate is made is the year following the year in which the company commenced doing business and subsection (d) applies, the average monthly gross income during the period from and after the commencement of business to the close of the year for which the estimate was made shall be determined and multiplied by twelve.\u00a0 Any variance between the estimate and the amount so computed shall be adjusted and a credit or refund made, or payment of additional tax due, depending upon whether the estimate was in excess of, or less than, the amount computed.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The amended return shall be made and filed and any additional tax
