[L 1995, c 92, pt of \u00a72; am L 2009, c 166, \u00a722; am L 2011, c 43, \u00a73]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Where, pursuant to this section, the Cheek interpretation of the wilfulness requirement--that a jury must be permitted to consider evidence of a defendant's good faith belief that defendant's conduct did not violate the tax laws, even if that belief was not objectively reasonable, in determining whether defendant acted wilfully--was adopted and applied in construing \u00a7231-36(a), the trial court erred in excluding defendant's exhibit pursuant to HRE rules 401 and 403 on the grounds that defendant's analysis of the tax laws was irrelevant and that evidence of defendant's legal theories would confuse the jury.\u00a0 119 H. 60 (App.), 193 P.3d 1260 (2008)."
