State.\u00a0 The Commission may meet any of its obligations in whole or in part with funds available to it under paragraph 1(i) of this Article:\u00a0 provided that the Commission takes specific action setting aside such funds prior to incurring any obligation to be met in whole or in part in such manner.\u00a0 Except where the Commission makes use of funds available to it under paragraph 1(i), the Commission shall not incur any obligation prior to the allotment of funds by the party States adequate to meet the same.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (d)\u00a0 The Commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements.\u00a0 The receipts and disbursements of the Commission shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established under its bylaws.\u00a0 All receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the Commission shall be audited yearly by a certified or licensed public accountant and the report of the audit shall be included in and become part of the annual report of the Commission.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (e)\u00a0 The accounts of the Commission shall be open at any reasonable time for inspection by duly constituted officers of the party States and by any persons authorized by the Commission.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (f)\u00a0 Nothing contained in this Article shall be construed to prevent Commission compliance with laws relating to audit or inspection of accounts by or on behalf of any government contributing to the support of the Commission.\n\u00a0\nArticle VII.\u00a0 Uniform Regulations and Forms.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1.\u00a0 Whenever any two or more party States, or subdivisions of party States, have uniform or similar provisions of law relating to an income tax, capital stock tax, gross receipts tax, sales or use tax, the Commission may adopt uniform regulations for any phase of the administration of such law, including assertion of jurisdiction to tax, or prescribing uniform tax forms.\u00a0 The Commission may also act with respect to the provisions of Article IV of this compact.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2.\u00a0 Prior to the adoption of any regulation, the Commission shall:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (a)\u00a0 As provided in its bylaws, hold at least one public hearing on due notice to all affected party States and subdivisions thereof and to all taxpayers and other persons who have made timely request of the Commission for advance notice of its regulation-making proceedings.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b)\u00a0 Afford all affected party States and subdivisions and interested persons an opportunity to submit relevant written data and views, which shall be considered fully by the Commission.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3.\u00a0 The Commission shall submit any regulations adopted by it to the appropriate officials of all party States and subdivisions to which they might apply.\u00a0 Each such State and subdivision shall consider any such regulation for adoption in accordance with its own laws and procedures.\n\u00a0\nArticle VIII.\u00a0 Interstate Audits.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1.\u00a0 This Article shall be in force only in those party States that specifically provide therefor by statute.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2.\u00a0 Any party State or subdivision thereof desiring to make or participate in an audit of any accounts, books, papers, records or other documents may request the Commission to perform the audit on its behalf.\u00a0 In responding to the request, the Commission shall have access to and may examine, at any reasonable time, such accounts, books, papers, records, and other documents and any relevant property or stock of merchandise.\u00a0 The Commission may enter into agreements with party States or their subdivisions for assistance in performance of the audit.\u00a0 The Commission shall make charges, to be paid by the State or local governments or governments for which it performs the service, for any audits performed by it in order to reimburse itself for the actual costs incurred in making the audit.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3.\u00a0 The Commission may require the attendance of any person within the State where it is conducting an audit or part thereof at a time and place fixed by it within such State for the purpose of giving testimony with respect to any account, book, paper, document, other record, property or stock of merchandise being examined in connection with the audit.\u00a0 If the person is not within the jurisdiction, he may be required to attend for such purpose at any time and place fixed by the Commission within the State of which he is a resident; provided that such State has adopted this Article.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 4.\u00a0 The Commission may apply to any court having power to issue compulsory process for orders in aid of its powers and responsibilities pursuant to this Article and any and all such courts shall have jurisdiction to issue such orders.\u00a0 Failure of any person to obey any such order shall be punishable as contempt of the issuing court.\u00a0 If the party or subject matter on account of which the Commission seeks an order is within the jurisdiction of the court to which application is made, such application may be to a court in the State or subdivision on behalf of which the audit is being made or a court in the State in which the object of the order being sought is situated.\u00a0 The provisions of this paragraph apply only to courts in a State that has adopted this Article.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 5.\u00a0 The Commission may decline to perform any audit requested if it finds that its available personnel or other resources are insufficient for the purpose or that, in the terms requested, the audit is impracticable of satisfactory performance.\u00a0 If the Commission, on the basis of its experience, has reason to believe that an audit of a particular taxpayer, either at a particular time or on a particular schedule, would be of interest to a number of party States or their subdivisions, it may offer to make the audit or audits, the offer to be contingent on sufficient participation therein as determined by the Commission.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6.\u00a0 Information obtained by any audit pursuant to this Article shall be confidential and available only for tax purposes to party States, their subdivisions or the United States.\u00a0 Availability of information shall be in accordance with the laws of the States or subdivisions on whose account the Commission performs the audit, and only through the appropriate agencies or officers of such States or subdivisions.\u00a0 Nothing in this Article shall be construed to require any taxpayer to keep records for any period not otherwise required by law.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 7.\u00a0 Other arrangements made or authorized pursuant to law for cooperative audit by or on behalf of the party States or any of their subdivisions are not superseded or invalidated by this Article.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 8.\u00a0 In no event shall the Commission make any charge against a taxpayer for an audit.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 9.\u00a0 As used in this Article, \"tax\", in addition to the meaning ascribed to it in Article II, means any tax or license fee imposed in whole or in part for revenue purposes.\n\u00a0\nArticle IX.\u00a0 Arbitration.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1.\u00a0 Whenever the Commission finds a need for settling disputes concerning apportionments and allocations by arbitration, it may adopt a regulation placing this Article in effect, notwithstanding the provisions of Article VII.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2.\u00a0 The Commission shall select and maintain an Arbitration Panel composed of officers and employees of State and local governments and private persons who shall be knowledgeable and experienced in matters of tax law and administration.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3.\u00a0 Whenever a taxpayer who has elected to employ Article IV, or whenever the laws of the party State or subdivision thereof are substantially identical with the relevant provisions of Article IV, the taxpayer, by written notice to the Commission and to each party State or subdivision thereof that would be affected, may secure arbitration of an apportionment or allocation, if he is dissatisfied with the final administrative determination of the tax agency of the State or subdivision with respect thereto on the ground that it would subject him to double or multiple taxation by two or more party States or subdivisions thereof.\u00a0 Each party State and subdivision thereof hereby consents to the arbitration as provided herein, and agrees to be bound thereby.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 4.\u00a0 The Arbitration Board shall be composed of one person selected by the taxpayer, one by the agency or agencies involved, and one member of the Commission's Arbitration Panel.\u00a0 If the agencies involved are unable to agree on the person to be selected by them, such person shall be selected by lot from the total membership of the Arbitration Panel.\u00a0 The two persons selected for the Board in the manner provided by the foregoing provisions of this paragraph shall jointly select the third member of the Board.\u00a0 If they are unable to agree on the selection, the third member shall be selected by lot from among the total membership of the Arbitration Panel.\u00a0 No member of a Board selected by lot shall be qualified to serve if he is an officer or employee or is otherwise affiliated with any party to the arbitration proceeding.\u00a0 Residence within the jurisdiction of a party to the arbitration proceeding shall not constitute affiliation within the meaning of this paragraph.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 5.\u00a0 The Board may sit in any State or subdivision party to the proceeding, in the State of the taxpayer's incorporation, residence or domicile, in any State where the taxpayer does business, or in any place that it finds most appropriate for gaining access to evidence relevant to the matter before it.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6.\u00a0 The Board shall give due notice of the times and places of its hearings.\u00a0 The parties shall be entitled to be heard, to present evidence, and to examine and cross-examine witnesses.\u00a0 The Board shall act by majority vote.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 7.\u00a0 The Board shall have power to administer oaths, take testimony, subpoena and require the attendance of witnesses and the production of accounts, books, papers, records, and other documents, and issue commissions to take testimony.\u00a0 Subpoenas may be signed by any member of the Board.\u00a0 In case of failure to obey a subpoena, and upon application by the Board, any judge of a court of competent jurisdiction of the State in which the Board is sitting or in which the person to whom the subpoena is directed may be found may make an order requiring compliance with the subpoena, and the court may punish failure to obey the order as a contempt.\u00a0 The provisions of this paragraph apply only in States that have adopted this Article.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 8.\u00a0 Unless the parties otherwise agree the expenses and other costs of the arbitration shall be assessed and allocated among the parties by the Board in such manner as it may determine.\u00a0 The Commission shall fix a schedule of compensation for members of Arbitration Boards and of other allowable expenses and costs.\u00a0 No officer or employee of a State or local government who serves as a member of a Board shall be entitled to compensation therefor unless he is required on account of his service to forego the regular compensation attaching to his public employment, but any such Board member shall be entitled to expenses.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 9.\u00a0 The Board shall determine the disputed apportionment or allocation and any matters necessary thereto.\u00a0 The determinations of the Board shall be final for purposes of making the apportionment or allocation, but for no other purpose.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 10.\u00a0 The Board shall file with the Commission and with each tax agency represented in the proceeding: the determination of the Board; the Board's written statement of its reasons therefor; the record of the Board's proceedings; and any other documents required by the arbitration rules of the Commission to be filed.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 11.\u00a0 The Commission shall publish the determination of Boards together with the statements of the reasons therefor.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 12.\u00a0 The Commission shall adopt and publish rules of procedure and practice and shall file a copy of such rules and of any amendment thereto with the appropriate agency or officer in each of the States.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 13.\u00a0 Nothing contained herein shall prevent at any time a written compromise of any matter or matters in dispute, if otherwise lawful, by the parties to the arbitration proceeding.\n\u00a0\nArticle X.\u00a0 Entry Into Force and Withdrawal.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1.\u00a0 This Compact shall enter into force when enacted into law by any seven States.\u00a0 Thereafter, this compact shall become effective as to any other State upon its enactment thereof.\u00a0 The Commission shall arrange for notification of all party States whenever there is a new enactment of the compact.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2.\u00a0 Any party State may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same.\u00a0 No withdrawal shall effect any liability already incurred by or chargeable to a party State prior to the time of such withdrawal.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3.\u00a0 No proceeding commenced before an Arbitration Board prior to the withdrawal of a State and to which the withdrawing State or any subdivision thereof is a party shall be discontinued or terminated by the withdrawal, nor shall the Board thereby lose jurisdiction over any of the parties to the proceeding necessary to make a binding determination therein.\n\u00a0\nArticle XI.\u00a0 Effect on Other Laws and Jurisdiction.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nothing in this compact shall be construed to:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (a)\u00a0 Affect the power of any State or subdivision thereof to fix rates of taxation, except that a party State shall be obligated to implement Article III 2 of this Compact.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b)\u00a0 Apply to any tax or fixed fee imposed for the registration of a motor vehicle or any tax on motor fuel, other than a sales tax; provided that the definition of \"tax\" in Article VIII 9 may apply for the purpose of that Article and the Commission's powers of study and recommendation pursuant to Article VI 3 may apply.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (c)\u00a0 Withdraw or limit the jurisdiction of any State or local court or administrative officer or body with respect to any person, corporation or other entity or subject matter, except to the extent that such jurisdiction is expressly conferred by or pursuant to this compact upon another agency or body.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (d)\u00a0 Supersede or limit the jurisdiction of any court of the United States.\n\u00a0\nArticle XII.\u00a0 Construction and Severability.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof.\u00a0 The provisions of this Compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this Compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any State or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this Compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.\u00a0 If this Compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any State participating therein, the Compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining party States and in full force and effect as to the State affected as to all severable matters.
