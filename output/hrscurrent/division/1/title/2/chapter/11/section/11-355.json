[L 2010, c 211, pt of \u00a72]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Hawaii's government contractor contribution ban under \u00a711-355 satisfies closely drawn scrutiny; it serves sufficiently important governmental interests by combating both actual and the appearance of quid pro quo corruption, and it is closely drawn because it targets direct contributions from contractors to officeholders and candidates, the contributions most closely linked to actual and perceived quid pro quo corruption.\u00a0 The ban survives closely drawn scrutiny even as applied to plaintiff's proposed contributions to candidates who neither decide whether plaintiff receives contracts nor oversee plaintiff's contracts.\u00a0 786 F.3d 1182 (2015).\n\u00a0 Hawaii's government-contractor ban on direct campaign contributions set forth in this section was constitutional as applied to plaintiff noncandidate committee and government contractor's proposed contributions; given the public role of legislators and the power (or perceived power) they can have in contractual matters, applying the contribution ban was closely connected to the government interest in refuting at least the perception of corruption in the electoral process; it functions to alleviate even the appearance of a connection (a quid pro quo) between a government contractor and a candidate for public office.\u00a0 872 F. Supp. 2d 1023 (2012).\n\u00a0 Plaintiff noncandidate committee and government contractor had standing to challenge the contribution restrictions on government contractors in this section, given that plaintiff was a government contractor, had made substantial contributions to candidates in the past, and sought to make future contributions while it was a contractor; moreover, plaintiff did not have to violate the statute to challenge its terms, and a favorable ruling would have allowed plaintiff to make contributions as a contractor without violating the law.\u00a0 872 F. Supp. 2d 1023 (2012)."
