[L 2010, c 211, pt of \u00a72; am L 2013, c 112, \u00a710; am L 2014, c 128, \u00a7\u00a72, 4]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 The disclaimer requirement under subsection (a)(2) did not violate the First Amendment as applied to plaintiff's political advertisements.\u00a0 786 F.3d 1182 (2015).\n\u00a0 Plaintiff noncandidate committee and government contractor had standing to challenge the \"advertising\" disclaimer requirements in subsection (a)(2)(B); first, even if plaintiff had already published advertisements with the disclaimers, it did not mean that it faced no injury; second, plaintiff sought a declaration that it need not include disclaimers in the future and challenged those statutes facially; third, plaintiff did not have to publish the advertisements without the disclaimers to have standing; finally, a favorable ruling would have enabled plaintiff to publish its advertisements without the disclaimers and fear of violating the law.\u00a0 872 F. Supp. 2d 1023 (2012).\n\u00a0 Plaintiff noncandidate committee and government contractor's as-applied challenge to the disclaimer requirement in subsection (a)(2)(B) and the corresponding definition of \"advertisement\" in \u00a711-302, which included the \"electioneering communications\" definitions in \u00a711-341(c), rejected; the court concluded that the plaintiff's advertisements fit within the regulatory \"safe harbor\"--they were an \"advertisement\" that was an \"electioneering communication\" and was the functional equivalent of express advocacy under \u00a711-341(c).\u00a0 872 F. Supp. 2d 1023 (2012).\n\u00a0 Plaintiff noncandidate committee and government contractor's facial challenge to the disclaimer requirement in subsection (a)(2)(B) failed; disclosure requirements could apply to issue advocacy, so long as the exacting scrutiny test was otherwise met, and disclosure and disclaimer requirements--such as requiring a disclaimer under federal law that a communication \"was not authorized by any candidate or candidate's committee\"--satisfied the exacting scrutiny test; in effect, the U.S. Supreme Court in \"Citizens United had effectively disposed of any attack on ... attribution and disclaimer requirements\".\u00a0 872 F. Supp. 2d 1023 (2012)."
