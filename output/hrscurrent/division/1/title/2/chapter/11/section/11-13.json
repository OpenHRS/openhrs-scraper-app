Gen. Op. 86-10.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 County board of registration did not err in finding that voter, by changing voter registration to Lahaina, where voter was living and working at the time, lost voter's residency on Lanai; by registering to vote in Lahaina, voter represented that it was voter's place of residence and that statement of intent, together with voter's habitation on Maui, established Maui as voter's residence.\u00a0 121 H. 297, 219 P.3d 1084 (2009).\n\u00a0 County board of registration did not err in finding that voter was a resident of Lahaina rather than Lanai for purposes of voting in the 2008 general election where voter did not abandon voter's residence in Lahaina and relocate voter's permanent residence to Lanai, voter did not own or work for a business on Lanai, did not own or rent a house or keep a car on the island, and substantial evidence supported the inference that voter had not established sufficient physical presence on Lanai where plaintiff had not seen voter at the post office, the store, gas station or restaurants, or either bank on Lanai.\u00a0 121 H. 297, 219 P.3d 1084 (2009).\n\u00a0 Mentioned:\u00a0 878 F. Supp. 2d 1124 (2012); 960 F. Supp. 2d 1074 (2013)."
