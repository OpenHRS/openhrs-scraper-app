Gen. Op. 70-23.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Circuit court erred in concluding that based upon individual's \"withdrawal\" from the district race, the office of elections was authorized pursuant to this section and/or \u00a711-118 to allow the Republican Party three additional days to identify a \"replacement\" candidate; individual could not have withdrawn individual's nomination papers as the papers were void and should never have been accepted and filed by the county clerk; therefore, without these additional days, replacement individual's nomination papers were filed after the statutory deadline and individual's name should not have been on the ballot.\u00a0 126 H. 115 (App.), 267 P.3d 699 (2011)."
