to the time set by law for the meeting and voting by the presidential electors, the chief election official of each member state shall determine the number of votes for each presidential slate in each state of the United States and in the District of Columbia in which votes have been cast in a statewide popular election and shall add such votes together to produce a \"national popular vote total\" for each presidential slate.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The chief election official of each member state shall designate the presidential slate with the largest national popular vote total as the \"national popular vote winner\".\u00a0 The presidential elector certifying official of each member state shall certify the appointment in that official's own state of the elector slate nominated in that state in association with the national popular vote winner.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At least six days before the day fixed by law for the meeting and voting by the presidential electors, each

any reason, the number of presidential electors nominated in a member state in association with the national popular vote winner is less than or greater than that state's number of electoral votes, the presidential candidate on the presidential slate that has been designated as the national popular vote winner shall have the power to nominate the presidential electors for that state and that state's presidential elector certifying official shall certify the appointment of such nominees.\u00a0 The chief election official of each member state shall immediately release to the public all vote counts or statements of votes as they are determined or obtained.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This article shall govern the appointment of presidential electors in each member state in any year in which

state.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Any member state may withdraw from this agreement, except that a withdrawal occurring six months or less before the end of a President's term shall not become effective until a President or Vice President shall have been qualified to serve the next term.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The chief executive of each member state shall promptly notify the chief

effect generally.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This agreement shall terminate if the electoral college is abolished.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If any provision of this agreement is held invalid, the
