provided that if a member is expelled from the association before the end of the ten-year period, the contract shall be void. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b)\u00a0 Damages for breach; effect upon membership status of association members. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 The contract may fix, as liquidated damages, which shall not be regarded as penalties, specified sums to be paid by the members to the association upon the breach of any provision of the contract, regarding the use of any facilities of the association or the sale, delivery, handling, or withholding of products; and may further provide that the member who breaks the member's contract shall pay all costs including premiums for bonds, and reasonable attorney's fees, to be fixed by the court, in case the association prevails in any action upon the contract. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 Any member who breaches any provision of the contract with the association shall be subject to removal from the association including the forfeiture of all rights and privileges pertinent to membership in the association as may be provided for in the bylaws of the association.\u00a0 In the absence of any provision in the association's bylaws relating to the removal of members, removal may occur by majority vote of the board of directors.\u00a0 Any member so removed shall be entitled to reapply for membership including the reinstatement of all such rights and privileges as may have been previously forfeited subject either to (A) any provision in the association's bylaws relating to readmission, or (B) in the absence of such provision, by majority vote of the board of directors at the time readmission is sought. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (c)\u00a0 Equitable relief.\u00a0 A court of competent jurisdiction may grant an injunction to prevent the breach of the contract by a member and may decree specific performance thereof. \u00a0Pending the adjudication of the action and upon filing a verified complaint showing the breach or threatened breach, and a bond in such form and amount as may be approved by the court, the court may grant a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction against the member. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (d)\u00a0 Recording contracts.\u00a0 The association may file contracts to sell agricultural products to or through the association in the office of the bureau of conveyances.\u00a0 If the association has uniform contracts with more than one member in any county, it may, in lieu of filing the original contracts, file the affidavit of its president, vice president, or secretary, containing or having attached thereto: \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 A true copy of the uniform contract entered into with its members producing the product in the county; \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 The names of the members who have executed the contract and a description of the land on which the produce is produced, if the description is contained in the contract. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The association may file from time to time thereafter affidavits containing revised or supplementary lists of the members producing the product in the county without setting forth therein a copy of the uniform contract but referring to the filed or recorded copy thereof.\u00a0 All affidavits filed under the section shall state in substance that they are filed pursuant to this section.\u00a0 The bureau of conveyances shall file the affidavits and make endorsements thereon and record and make entries thereof in the same manner as is required by law in the case of chattel mortgages, and shall compile and make available for public inspection a convenient index containing the names of all signers of the contracts, and collect for its services hereunder the same fees as for chattel mortgages.\u00a0 The filing of the contract, or the affidavit, shall constitute constructive notice of the association's title or right to the product embraced in the contract, to all subsequent purchasers, encumbrancers, creditors, and to all persons dealing with the members with reference to the product.\u00a0 No title, right, or lien of any kind shall be acquired to or on the product thereafter except through the association or with its consent, or subject to its rights; and the association may recover the possession of such property from any and all subsequent purchasers, encumbrancers, and creditors, and those claiming under them, in whose possession the same may be found, by any appropriate action for the recovery of personal property, and it may have relief by injunction and for damages. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (e)\u00a0 Effect of other statutes upon contracts.\u00a0 The provisions of this chapter are intended to encourage and to authorize associations to effectively produce and market agricultural products, and to derive the maximum benefits possible from such cooperative production and marketing.\u00a0 Accordingly, the contracts between an association and its members shall be deemed to authorize the collective production and marketing of the members' products, including but not limited to the combining, pooling and blending of production quotas, marketing adjustments and distribution rights, the provisions of any other law to the contrary notwithstanding.\u00a0 This section shall be liberally construed in favor of associations and their contracts with their members.
