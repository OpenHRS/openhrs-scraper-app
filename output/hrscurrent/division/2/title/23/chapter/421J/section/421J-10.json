[L 1997, c 132, pt of \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Where charter was not recorded, and because homeowner association's first amended declaration could not reasonably be interpreted as creating the requisite authority in the association to impose a mandatory payment of money for maintenance or services, the association was not an \"association\" under the plain meaning of \u00a7421J-2; thus, association was not entitled to fees and costs pursuant to this section.\u00a0 114 H. 361, 162 P.3d 1277 (2007).\n\u00a0 Where homeowners' association did not qualify as an association because it was not granted authority in a declaration satisfying the statutory definition of \"association\" in \u00a7421J-2, trial court erred in awarding attorney's fees and costs pursuant to this section.\u00a0 112 H. 356 (App.), 145 P.3d 899 (2006)."
