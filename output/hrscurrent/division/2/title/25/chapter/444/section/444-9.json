[L 1957, c 305, \u00a71(s 8); Supp, \u00a7166A-8; HRS \u00a7444-9]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Pursuant to this section, a general engineering or building contractor is prohibited from doing any work that would require it to act as a specialty contractor in an area the general contractor was not licensed to operate; where project required plumbing work classified as C-37 specialty work, general contractor, which did not hold a C-37 specialty license, could not do work in that area; court thus erred in holding that project did not require work in the C-37 classification and that general contractor did not have to engage a specialty contractor holding a C-37 specialty license.\u00a0 97 H. 450, 40 P.3d 73 (2002)."
