[L 1961, c 190, \u00a77; Supp, \u00a7205A-7; HRS \u00a7480-9]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Mentioned in discussing availability of estoppel as defense in private antitrust action.\u00a0 296 F. Supp. 920.\n\u00a0 One element of conspiracy to monopolize is specific intent to control prices or destroy competition in any line of trade or commerce.\u00a0 Test for specific intent is the same, whether applied to conspiracy or attempt to monopolize.\u00a0 491 F. Supp. 1199. \n\u00a0 Defendants lacked necessary market share and hence monopoly power in service jobbing of all tobacco products in Hawaii.\u00a0 513 F. Supp. 726.\n\u00a0 Mere formality of separate incorporation is not, without more, sufficient to provide the capability for conspiracy.\u00a0 Parent corporation controlled subsidiary to such a degree that the two entities in substance constitute a single entity incapable of conspiring with itself.\u00a0 513 F. Supp. 726. \n\u00a0 Action by shopping center tenant against shopping center owner.\u00a0 530 F. Supp. 499.\n\u00a0 Large landowner's monopoly power over own lands not illegal where not used to injure competitors.\u00a0 594 F. Supp. 1480.\n\u00a0 Mentioned, where plaintiff alleged that defendants' practice of imposing maximum price restrictions in rebate program for the installation of solar water heaters violated state and federal antitrust law, and summary judgment granted for defendants on plaintiffs' claims based on Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act and state antitrust claims.\u00a0 409 F. Supp. 2d 1206.\n\u00a0 Elements of offense of monopoly.\u00a0 63 H. 289, 627 P.2d 260.\n\u00a0 Federal statutes and decisions are to be used as guides.\u00a0 63 H. 289, 627 P.2d 260.\n\u00a0 Where appellants failed to adduce evidence of a causal connection\u00a0 between appellees' \"anticompetitive\" conduct and appellees' alleged monopoly power, trial court properly concluded that there was insufficient evidence to sustain appellants' attempt to monopolize claim under this section; thus, as appellants failed to prove a violation of chapter 480, appellants had no standing to bring claim for relief under \u00a7480-13(a).\u00a0 91 H. 224, 982 P.2d 853.\n\u00a0 Where economic interest of corporation's officer/majority shareholder's was the same as that of corporation's two wholly-owned subsidiaries, officer/majority shareholder could not conspire with the corporation for purposes of \u00a7480-4 or this section.\u00a0 91 H. 224, 982 P.2d 853.\n\u00a0 Where the two companies were wholly-owned subsidiaries of the same parent corporation and shared a singular economic interest, they could not constitute a plurality of actors for purposes of a conspiracy under \u00a7480-4 or this section.\u00a0 91 H. 224, 982 P.2d 853."
