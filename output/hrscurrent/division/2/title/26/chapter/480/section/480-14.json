[L 1961, c 190, \u00a712; Supp, \u00a7205A-12; HRS \u00a7480-14; am L 1980, c 69, \u00a72; am L 1981, c 22, \u00a71; am L 1987, c 274, \u00a75; am L 1988, c 60, \u00a72 and c 141, \u00a7\u00a752, 53; am L 2001, c 79, \u00a72; am L 2002, c 229, \u00a74; am L 2003, c 13, \u00a71; am L 2008, c 19, \u00a75; am L 2011, c 66, \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Defendants contended that under subsection (b), any action brought by the attorney general on behalf of consumers was perforce a class action; however, because the complaints unambiguously disclaimed class status, the actions could not be removed under the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005.\u00a0\u00a0 761 F.3d 1027 (2014).\n\u00a0 District court rejected the attorney general's interpretation of subsection (b) as authorizing the attorney general to bring parens patriae suits regarding violations of \u00a7480-2 as either a class action or a non-class action.\u00a0 If the attorney general brings an action to recover damages on behalf of Hawaii consumers pursuant to subsection (b), the attorney general can only do so in a parens patriae class action.\u00a0 907 F. Supp. 2d 1188 (2012).\n\u00a0 The statement in subsection (b) that the attorney general \"may bring a class action\" is merely a recognition that the attorney general has the discretion, as opposed to a statutory obligation, to bring a parens patriae class action in response to violations of \u00a7480-2.\u00a0 907 F. Supp. 2d 1188 (2012)."
