Supp. 1296.\n\u00a0 Plaintiffs may recover for \u00a7480-2 violations which occurred prior to four-year statute of limitations if they can prove fraudulent concealment; series of fly-drive arrangements constituted alleged continuing violation; section did not bar claims for fly-drives occurring less than four years prior to filing of action.\u00a0 491 F. Supp. 1199.\n\u00a0 If State proved a continuing violation, it would be entitled to seek provable damages for the entire period of the continuing violation; this could include damages that might have occurred prior to the four years before suit was filed, if the continuing violation occurred during that period.\u00a0 168 F. Supp. 2d 1180.\n\u00a0 Plaintiff's claim\u00a0 under \u00a7480-2 failed, where the statute of limitations barred any unlawful business practice claim that occurred prior to the four-year limitation period and although the additional alleged occurrences would not be time-barred, plaintiff's asserted damages flowing from the violation were unrecoverable because they were speculative.\u00a0 522 F. Supp. 2d 1272.\n\u00a0 Fraudulent concealment may toll this section's statute of limitations.\u00a0 777 F. Supp. 2d 1224 (2011).\n\u00a0 Discussed:\u00a0 792 F. Supp. 2d 1111 (2011); 907 F.
