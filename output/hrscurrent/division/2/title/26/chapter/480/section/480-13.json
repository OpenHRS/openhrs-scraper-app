provided that indirect purchasers injured by an illegal overcharge shall recover only compensatory damages, and reasonable attorney's fees together with the costs of suit in actions not brought under section 480-14(c);

provided that:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 The minimum $1,000 recovery provided in subsections (a) and (b) shall not apply in a class action or a de facto class action lawsuit;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 In class actions or de facto class actions where both direct and indirect purchasers are involved, or where more than one class of indirect purchasers are involved, a defendant shall be entitled to prove as a partial or complete defense to a claim for compensatory damages that the illegal overcharge has been passed on or passed back to others who are themselves entitled to recover so as to avoid the duplication of recovery of compensatory damages;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (3)\u00a0 That portion of threefold damages in excess of compensatory damages shall be apportioned and allocated by the court in its exercise of discretion so as to promote effective enforcement of this chapter and deterrence from violation of its provisions;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (4)\u00a0 In no event shall an indirect purchaser be awarded less than the full measure of compensatory damages attributable to the indirect purchaser;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (5)\u00a0 In any lawsuit or lawsuits in which claims are asserted by both direct purchasers and indirect purchasers, the court is authorized to exercise its discretion in the apportionment of damages, and in the transfer and consolidation of cases to avoid the duplication of the recovery of damages and the multiplicity of suits, and in other respects to obtain substantial fairness;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (6)\u00a0 In any case in which claims are being asserted by a part of the claimants in a court of this State and another part of the claimants in a court other than of this State, where the claims arise out of same or overlapping transactions, the court is authorized to take all steps reasonable and necessary to avoid duplication of recovery of damages and multiplicity of suits, and in other respects, to obtain substantial fairness;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (7)\u00a0 In instances where indirect purchasers file an action and obtain a judgment or settlement prior to the completion of a direct purchaser's action in courts other than this State, the court shall delay disbursement of the damages until such time as the direct purchaser's suits are resolved to either final judgment, consent decree or settlement, or in the absence of a direct purchaser's lawsuit in the courts other than this State by direct purchasers, the expiration of the statute of limitations, or in such manner that will minimize duplication of damages to the extent reasonable and practicable, avoid multiplicity of suit, and obtain substantial fairness;

Rev. 687 (2013).\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Divestiture is not available remedy in private action.\u00a0 518 F.2d 913.\n\u00a0 Requires showing that suit in public interest; may be proven by knowledge of illegality. \u00a0732 F.2d 1403.\n\u00a0 In action by physician relating to termination of hospital staff privileges, public interest favors hospital.\u00a0 754 F.2d 1420.\n\u00a0 Public interest requirement not met by employer's negligent misrepresentation that it guaranteed employees full payment of their pensions.\u00a0 804 F.2d 1418.\n\u00a0 Section creates private right of action for violations of \u00a7480-2.\u00a0 809 F.2d 626.\n\u00a0 Appellant debtor's claim under this section remanded to the bankruptcy court to make the proper requisite findings of fact under this section where the bankruptcy court's findings of fact appear to establish that debtor's losses \"result[ed] from\" debtor's default, rather than from appellee lenders' failure to shout out the postponement of the foreclosure sale of debtor's property.\u00a0 674 F.3d 1083 (2012).\n\u00a0 A borrower need only allege that a lender has breached its statutory duty not to engage in \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce\" in a way that caused private damages in order to state a claim under this section and \u00a7480-2.\u00a0 761 F.3d 1046 (2014).\n\u00a0 District courts evaluating whether a borrower's complaint states a claim under this section and \u00a7480-2 against a lender need only address whether the complaint adequately alleges that the lender used unfair or deceptive acts in its relationship with the borrower, without looking to negligence law to determine whether the lender breached a common law duty of care.\u00a0 761 F.3d 1046 (2014).\n\u00a0 Availability of laches, estoppel, and unclean hands as defenses in private antitrust action discussed.\u00a0 296 F. Supp. 920.\n\u00a0 Past or impending anticompetitive behavior justifying injunctive relief was not shown.\u00a0 491 F. Supp. 1199.\n\u00a0 Section 480-13 creates private right of action for violations of \u00a7480-2.\u00a0 491 F. Supp. 1199.\n\u00a0 Real estate transaction not a sale of goods or services, therefore defendants were not \"merchants\" within meaning of statute; there is insufficient public interest to bring a suit under this section where there is merely a sale of a hotel from one private party to another.\u00a0 680 F. Supp. 1438.\n\u00a0 Although a damage claim under this section based on violations of \u00a7480-2 may only be asserted against the wrongdoer, a rescission claim under chapter 480 can stand against subsequent assignees if the contract is void; where plaintiff had alleged that defendant mortgage broker assigned or sold loans to other defendants, plaintiff could seek rescission against other defendants if mortgage broker violated chapter 480 and the loans were void; however, a plaintiff seeking affirmatively to void a mortgage transaction under \u00a7480-12 must \"place the parties in as close a position as they held prior to the transaction\".\u00a0 861 F. Supp. 2d 1153 (2012).\n\u00a0 Because the language contained in \u00a7480-2 is similar to California's statute, and since plaintiff appears to base plaintiff's claim on \"fraudulent concealment\", plaintiff was required to plead plaintiff's unfair and deceptive trade practices claim with specificity; defendants' motion to dismiss based on this issue granted.\u00a0 730 F. Supp. 2d 1213 (2010).\n\u00a0 Plaintiffs' unfair or deceptive acts or practices claims dismissed; this section and \u00a7480-2 do not provide a cause of action for personal injury claims.\u00a0 100 F. Supp. 2d 1265 (2010).\n\u00a0 Plaintiff not entitled to summary judgment on plaintiff's claim under this section, as plaintiff failed to establish that plaintiff was actually damaged by defendant's failure to register as a debt collector.\u00a0 183 F. Supp. 2d 1234.\n\u00a0 A municipality may be held liable under this chapter if its act is done \"in the conduct of any trade or commerce\", but is not subject to a treble damage penalty.\u00a0 215 F. Supp. 2d 1098.\n\u00a0 Requisites of allegations for standing purposes.\u00a0 61 H. 607, 607 P.2d 1304.\n\u00a0 Policy is to foster private actions even where acts do not culminate in injury to competition.\u00a0 63 H. 289, 627 P.2d 260.\n\u00a0 As between common law fraud claim and chapter 480 claim, where election of remedies was not unequivocal and knowledgeable, plaintiff not estopped from recovering under statutory claim.\u00a0 80 H. 54, 905 P.2d 29.\n\u00a0 Real estate or residences did not qualify as \"goods\" under \u00a7480-1, but did qualify as \"personal investments\"; homebuyer thus had standing as \"consumer\" to bring claim under this section.\u00a0 80 H. 54, 905 P.2d 29.\n\u00a0 Under subsection (b)(1), award of attorneys' fees are mandatory and comprise portion of the statutory recovery for purposes of calculating the \"greater amount\" of recovery.\u00a0 80 H. 54, 905 P.2d 29.\n\u00a0 Where employee was not a \"consumer\" as defined under \u00a7480-1, employee lacked standing to maintain private cause of action under this section against workers' compensation insurer based on alleged violation of \u00a7480-2.\u00a0 83 H. 457, 927 P.2d 858.\n\u00a0 Where employer was not a \"consumer\" as defined under \u00a7480-1, employee could not maintain action under this section, based on employee's third party beneficiary status, against workers' compensation insurer for alleged violation of \u00a7480-2.\u00a0 83 H. 457, 927 P.2d 858.\n\u00a0 There is no private claim for relief under this section for unfair methods of competition in violation of \u00a7480-2; private remedy is restricted to claims of unfair or deceptive acts or practices.\u00a0 91 H. 224, 982 P.2d 853.\n\u00a0 Where appellants failed to adduce evidence of a causal connection\u00a0 between appellees' \"anticompetitive\" conduct and appellees' alleged monopoly power, trial court properly concluded that there was insufficient evidence to sustain appellants' attempt to monopolize claim under \u00a7480-9; thus, as appellants failed to prove a violation of chapter 480, appellants had no standing to bring claim for relief under subsection (a).\u00a0 91 H. 224, 982 P.2d 853.\n\u00a0 As subsection (b) enumerates the specific damages that a consumer may recover under this chapter and makes no provision for punitive damages, plaintiffs were precluded from seeking punitive damages under this chapter.\u00a0 98 H. 309, 47 P.3d 1222.\n\u00a0 By the plain language of this chapter, no actual purchase is necessary as a prerequisite to a consumer recovering damages under this section, based on injuries stemming from violations of \u00a7480-2.\u00a0 98 H. 309, 47 P.3d 1222.\n\u00a0 Where plaintiff alleged that, as a result of defendant's unfair or deceptive practices, plaintiff was required to divert substantial resources and time to deal with its members' problems created by defendant's conduct--\"resources that otherwise would go to support its principal mission in service of its members\", plaintiff sufficiently alleged the \"injury to business or property\" element essential to recovery under this section.\u00a0 113 H. 77, 148 P.3d 1179.\n\u00a0 Although plaintiffs were \"consumers\" within the meaning of \u00a7480-1 and this section, plaintiffs' payment of their Hawaii medical services association (HMSA) lien to the Kentucky-based company that contracted with HMSA to provide subrogation and \"claims recovery services\", but which had violated \u00a7443B-3 (collection agency registration requirements), did not constitute an injury for which plaintiffs could bring suit under subsection (b).\u00a0 117 H. 153, 177 P.3d 341.\n\u00a0 Employees are \"any persons\" within the meaning of \u00a7\u00a7480-1 and 480-2(e) and are within the category of plaintiffs who have standing to bring a claim under \u00a7480-2(e) for a violation of \u00a7481B-14; however, based on the allegations contained in employees' amended complaint, employees did not sufficiently allege the \"nature of the competition\" to bring a claim for damages against employer under \u00a7\u00a7480-2(e) and subsection (a) for a violation of \u00a7481B-14.\u00a0 122 H. 423, 228 P.3d 303 (2010).\n\u00a0 Liability under section not limited to injuries to business; does not extend to personal injury actions.\u00a0 1 H. App. 111, 615 P.2d 749.\n\u00a0 Damages for mental distress and suffering are not recoverable.\u00a0 2 H. App. 301, 632 P.2d 1071.\n\u00a0 Lender of domestic currency is not a \"merchant\".\u00a0 2 H. App. 301, 632 P.2d 1071.\n\u00a0 Essential elements for cause of action under this section.\u00a0 2 H. App. 435, 634 P.2d 111.\n\u00a0 Legislature was aware that damages might be de minimus in a consumer action and specifically provided for the $1,000 award or triple damages to cover that possibility.\u00a0 2 H. App. 435, 634 P.2d 111.\n\u00a0 Does not supersede remedy for common law fraud; corporation's president was \"merchant\".\u00a0 6 H. App. 125, 712 P.2d 1148.\n\u00a0 Plaintiff suing store's commercial general liability insurer for injuries received in slip and fall was not \"consumer\" as defined in \u00a7480-1, and therefore lacked standing to maintain private cause of action under this section.\u00a0 82 H. 363 (App.), 922 P.2d 976.\n\u00a0 When litigant is entitled to treble damages under this section, trial court shall not award three times compensatory damages plus compensatory damages; proper measurement of treble damages is simply three times compensatory damages.\u00a0 84 H. 162 (App.), 931 P.2d 604.\n\u00a0 In action by consumer under \u00a7480-2, \"unclean hands\" of consumer not a defense to claim for damages under subsection (b)(1).\u00a0 86 H. 405 (App.), 949 P.2d 1026.\n\u00a0 Though section does not provide for setoff in unfair and deceptive trade practice cases, under certain circumstances, such setoff allowable; court properly awarded defendant car dealer car's ten-day rental value and cost of repairs for damage to car inflicted by plaintiff.\u00a0 86 H. 405 (App.), 949 P.2d 1026.\n\u00a0 Trebling of damages under subsection (b)(1) should be calculated before setoff award to defendant is applied.\u00a0 86 H. 405 (App.), 949 P.2d 1026."
