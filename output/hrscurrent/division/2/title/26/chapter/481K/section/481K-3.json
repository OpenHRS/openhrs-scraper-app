[L 1997, c 282, pt of \u00a71; am L 2008, c 19, \u00a727]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 An \"adjustment\" is included within the term \"repair\" inasmuch as the purpose of the \"repair\" is to \"correct\" a nonconformity; the trial court could thus find, under the circumstances of the case, that plaintiff's efforts to return for \"adjustments\" were a factor, among others, in determining whether plaintiff provided hearing aid dealer with a reasonable opportunity to \"repair\" the nonconformity.\u00a0 119 H. 483, 199 P.3d 72 (2009).\n\u00a0 Where plaintiff's testimony that plaintiff (1) returned the device four or five times prior to the May repair, (2) was without the device for about a month during the May repair, (3) came in for another \"adjustment\" when the device was returned from the manufacturer in late May and (4) throughout the course of these adjustments, plaintiff noticed no change in the device but continued to experience the same problems, evidence supported the conclusion that plaintiff provided dealer with a reasonable opportunity to repair.\u00a0 119 H. 483, 199 P.3d 72 (2009).\n\u00a0 Where there was substantial evidence that plaintiff's hearing aids were functioning poorly and inadequately, so much so that despite plaintiff's hearing disability, plaintiff never used the devices for a full day and determined that plaintiff was better off not using them at all, and based on plaintiff's testimony, plaintiff was only able to hear sounds that were close, at times only those that were far away, and all kinds of noises, the trial court could properly conclude that plaintiff's hearing aids were nonconforming and not fit for their ordinary purpose.\u00a0 119 H. 483, 199 P.3d 72 (2009)."
