[L 1997, c 282, pt of \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Where plaintiff ultimately prevailed on the principal issues on appeal concerning the definition of \"nonconformity\" in \u00a7481K-1 and whether defendant was given a reasonable opportunity to repair the nonconformity, plaintiff was the \"prevailing party\" for purposes of awarding appellate costs and attorney fees; as subsection (c) allows a court to award \"reasonable attorney fees\" stemming from proceedings at both the trial and appellate levels, and plaintiff provided a list of requested fees in accordance with HRAP rule 39(d)(1) which were not objected to by defendant, plaintiff's request for attorney's fees was granted.\u00a0 120 H. 257, 204 P.3d 476 (2009).\n\u00a0 Notwithstanding seller's failure to provide buyer with the required written warranty of fitness for ordinary purposes under \u00a7481K-2(a), where buyer failed to establish that buyer suffered any damages caused by that violation, the violation did not support the trial court's award of damages in the case.\u00a0 118 H. 285 (App.), 188 P.3d 799 (2008)."
