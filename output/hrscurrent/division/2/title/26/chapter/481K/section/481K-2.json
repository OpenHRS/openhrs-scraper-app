[L 1997, c 282, pt of \u00a71]\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Hearing aid dealer was also acting as the hearing aid manufacturer's agent in the capacity of warrantor, and therefore, in that capacity, was governed by this chapter's requirements pertaining to a \"manufacturer\".\u00a0 119 H. 483, 199 P.3d 72 (2009).\n\u00a0 Where there was substantial evidence that plaintiff's hearing aids were functioning poorly and inadequately, so much so that despite plaintiff's hearing disability, plaintiff never used the devices for a full day and determined that plaintiff was better off not using them at all, and based on plaintiff's testimony, plaintiff was only able to hear sounds that were close, at times only those that were far away, and all kinds of noises, the trial court could properly conclude that plaintiff's hearing aids were nonconforming and not fit for their ordinary purpose.\u00a0 119 H. 483, 199 P.3d 72 (2009).\n\u00a0 Notwithstanding seller's failure to provide buyer with the required written warranty of fitness for ordinary purposes under subsection (a), where buyer failed to establish that buyer suffered any damages caused by that violation, the violation did not support the trial court's award of damages in the case.\u00a0 118 H. 285 (App.), 188 P.3d 799 (2008).\n\u00a0 Where neither manufacturer's warranty card nor seller's guarantee document stated that \"the manufacturer warrants that the assistive device is fit for the ordinary purposes for which the device is used\", or words to that effect, as is required by subsection (a), trial court did not err in finding that the warranties failed to comply with subsections (a) and (b).\u00a0 118 H. 285 (App.), 188 P.3d 799 (2008)."
