[L 1969, c 187, pt of \u00a71; gen ch 1985]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Where there was no evidence in the record that plaintiffs knew that their claim under this chapter was \"groundless\", as required for an award of attorneys' fees under subsection (b), trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for attorneys' fees and costs under this section.\u00a0 98 H. 309, 47 P.3d 1222.\n\u00a0 Where plaintiffs' claims were based on a common core of facts, occurred roughly within the same two-month span of time, and were based on similar legal theories, such that it appeared that counsels' time was devoted largely to the litigation as a whole and not divisible into discrete slivers neatly matching each claim advanced, and the trial judge was in the best position to assess the reasonableness of counsels' actions, trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding fifty per cent of the attorneys' fees requested by plaintiffs.\u00a0 116 H. 42 (App.), 169 P.3d 994."
