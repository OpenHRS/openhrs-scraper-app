Supp. 2d 1061 (2011).\n\u00a0 No \"likelihood of confusion\" found.\u00a0 399 F. Supp. 604; 5 H. App. 194, 683 P.2d 1220.\n\u00a0 Plaintiff's likelihood of confusion allegations may support both \u00a7\u00a7480-2 unfair methods of competition and 481A [sic] deceptive acts or practices claims.\u00a0 945 F. Supp. 1344."
