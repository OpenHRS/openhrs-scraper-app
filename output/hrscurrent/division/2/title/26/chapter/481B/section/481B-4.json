[L 1969, c 213, \u00a74; am L 1974, c 255, \u00a72; am L 1996, c 59, \u00a74; am L 2008, c 19, \u00a713]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Plaintiff hotel employees' claim, brought pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7480-2 and 481B-14 and this section, was not preempted by \u00a7301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7185(a), because plaintiffs were not enforcing a right conferred only by the collective bargaining agreement (agreement) but rather an independent right conferred by state law; resolution of plaintiffs' state law claim was not dependent on any provision contained in the agreement and did not require interpretation of the agreement.\u00a0 835 F. Supp. 2d 914 (2011).\n\u00a0 Plaintiffs' claim pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7481B-14 and 480-2 and this section dismissed because (1) they had not alleged harm to competition; (2) merely alleging competition between hotels that result in lower prices did not give rise to antitrust injury; (3) no authority to support plaintiffs \"competing\" with defendant for tips, that there was a competitive market that defendant was a part of for tips, or that defendant's actions regarding service charges had a negative effect on that market; and (4) statements that their injuries were \"inextricably intertwined\" with defendant's acts did not establish that defendant caused any negative effect on competition.\u00a0 835 F. Supp. 2d 914 (2011)."
