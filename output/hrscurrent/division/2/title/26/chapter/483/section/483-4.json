[L 1941, c 60, \u00a74; RL 1945, \u00a78744; RL 1955, \u00a7192-4; HRS \u00a7483-4; gen ch 1985]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Where there was no reservation of rights in purchase agreement option by obligee against one co-obligor and no relationship between the co-obligors as joint debtors requiring payment, indemnification or contribution, \u00a7483-5 did not apply; thus, as there was no reservation of rights in purchase option by obligee against one co-obligor, as required under this section, the purchase option which discharged that co-obligor from liability for the balance due under the agreement of sale discharged the other co-obligor as well.\u00a0 89 H. 461 (App.), 974 P.2d 1051."
