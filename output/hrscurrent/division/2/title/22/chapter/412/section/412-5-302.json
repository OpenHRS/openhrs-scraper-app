and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (7)\u00a0 Loans and extensions of credit arising from the discount of negotiable or nonnegotiable credit sales contracts which carry a partial recourse endorsement or limited guarantee by the person transferring the credit sales contracts, if the bank's respective file or the knowledge of its officers of the financial condition of each maker of the credit sales contract is reasonably adequate, and an officer of the bank certifies in writing that the bank is relying primarily upon the responsibility of each maker for payment of the credit sales contract, and not upon any partial recourse endorsement or limited guarantee by the transferor.\u00a0 Under these circumstances, the credit sales contract will be considered a loan and extension of credit to the maker of the credit sales contract rather than the seller of the credit sales contract.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (e)\u00a0 In computing the total loans and extensions of credit made by a bank to any person, all loans and extensions of credit by the bank to the person and to any partnership, joint venture, or unincorporated association of which the person is a partner or a member and all credit exposure arising from a derivative transaction with any person and with any partnership, joint venture, or unincorporated association of which the person is a partner or a member shall be included unless the person is a limited partner, but not a general partner, in a limited partnership, or unless the person is a partner in a limited or general partnership, or a member of a joint venture or unincorporated association, if such partner or member, by law, by the terms of the partnership, joint venture, or membership agreement, or by the terms of an agreement with the bank, is not to be held liable to the bank for the debts of the partnership, joint venture, or association.\u00a0 In computing the total loans and extensions of credit made by a bank to any firm, partnership, joint venture, or unincorporated association, all loans and extensions of credit to and all credit exposure arising from a derivative transaction with its individual partners or members shall be included unless such individual partner is a limited partner, but not a general partner, in a limited partnership, or unless such individual partner or member, by law, by the terms of the partnership, joint venture, or membership agreement, or by the terms of an agreement with the bank, is not to be held liable to the bank for the debts of the partnership, joint venture, or association.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (f)\u00a0 Alternatively, a bank may, with the prior approval of the commissioner, comply with the lending limits applicable to federal financial institutions, as and to the same extent it would, at the time, be so required by federal law or regulation if it were a federal financial institution.\u00a0 A bank utilizing this alternative shall use a single method for calculating lending limits, including any credit exposure to the person arising from a derivative transaction, repurchase agreement, reverse purchase agreement, securities lending transaction, or securities borrowing transaction between the bank and the person.\u00a0 In monitoring a bank's compliance with the federal financial institution lending limits, the commissioner shall give substantial weight to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's regulations and opinions interpreting the federal financial institution lending limits, including but not limited to those related to the internal model method or the conversion factor matrix method for calculating credit exposure to derivative transactions as described in title 12 Code of Federal Regulations part 32 of the Interim Rule as may be amended.\u00a0 The commissioner will regard the regulations and opinions as strong evidence of safe and sound banking practices.
