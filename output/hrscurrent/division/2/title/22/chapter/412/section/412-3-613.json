provided that the sale or assumption shall be approved by the shareholders or members of the transferring Hawaii financial institution at a meeting duly called and noticed and upon a vote which satisfies the requirements of section 412:3-604.\u00a0 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the approval of the shareholders or members of the transferring institution shall not be required if the acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets or business, or the assumption of liabilities or deposits, of any of the transferring financial institution's departments or branches does not constitute an acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets or business, or assumption of all or substantially all of the liabilities or deposits, of the transferring financial institution.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (c)\u00a0 The participants in the transaction shall jointly file an application with the commissioner pursuant to section 412:3\u2011603 for approval of the plan of acquisition or assumption.\u00a0 The application shall contain:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 The plan of acquisition or assumption which shall include, but not be limited to, the names and types of participants involved, the material terms of the transaction, and the provisions as to the manner in which the participants in the transaction will comply with all applicable federal and state law;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 A certificate signed by two executive officers of each of the participants in the transaction verifying that the attached copy of the resolution approving the plan of acquisition or assumption adopted by the board of directors of each of the participants in the transaction is true and correct; and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (3)\u00a0 Any other information that the commissioner may require.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (d)\u00a0 The commissioner may require notice to be given to the public as may seem appropriate.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (e)\u00a0 The commissioner shall approve the acquisition or assumption if it appears that:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 The depositors, beneficiaries, creditors, shareholders, or members, and other persons having any interest in the transferring financial institution will be adequately protected under the plan of acquisition or assumption;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 The amount paid for the acquisition or assumption was determined at arm's length, and does not appear to be fraudulent;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (3)\u00a0 The plan of acquisition or assumption does not adversely affect the stability of the acquiring or assuming participant if the participant is a Hawaii financial institution, and, if the sale is part of the liquidation of the transferring financial institution, provides for the orderly dissolution of the transferring institution in a manner consistent with law;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (4)\u00a0 If one or more of the participants in the transaction is subject to federal regulation, the participants will comply with all applicable federal laws;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (5)\u00a0 The overall experience, moral character, or integrity of the directors and executive officers of the acquiring or assuming participant is consistent with the interest of the depositors, beneficiaries, creditors, or shareholders of the acquiring or assuming participant, or in the public interest;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (6)\u00a0 The acquisition or assumption will not jeopardize the safety or soundness of any Hawaii financial institution which is a participant in the transaction, and is not otherwise contrary to the public interest;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (7)\u00a0 The proposed acquisition or assumption will not substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly or restraint of trade in any section of the country that includes this State or a part thereof, or that any of these anti-competitive effects are clearly outweighed in the public interest by the probable effect of the acquisition or assumption in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served; and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (8)\u00a0 The plan of acquisition or assumption meets such other criteria as the commissioner may deem appropriate.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (f)\u00a0 Upon any required approval by the shareholders or members of the transferring financial institution, two executive officers of the institution shall deliver to the commissioner a certificate that the sale or assumption was duly approved by the shareholders or members of the transferring institution.\u00a0 If the commissioner is satisfied that the participants in the transaction have complied with all applicable state and federal law with regard to the adoption of the plan of acquisition or assumption, the commissioner shall give written approval to the participants in the transaction to proceed with the plan to acquire or sell assets or to assume liabilities.
