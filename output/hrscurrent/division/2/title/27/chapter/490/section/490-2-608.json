[L 1965, c 208, \u00a72-608; HRS \u00a7490:2-608]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Even assuming the parties intended defendant to be bound by specifications provided by plaintiff and the vinyl louvers manufactured by defendant were nonconforming, genuine issues of material fact remained as to plaintiff's revocation of acceptance of the louvers; the window installation subcontractor's cutting and installation of the louvers did not substantially change the louvers for the purposes of revocation.\u00a0 591 F. Supp. 2d 1131 (2008).\n\u00a0 Did not authorize defendant to revoke acceptance of nonconforming goods where defendant prevented plaintiff's reasonable attempts to seasonably cure the nonconformity.\u00a0 10 H. App. 368, 874 P.2d 1100."
