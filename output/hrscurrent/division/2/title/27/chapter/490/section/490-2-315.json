Rev. 55.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 A genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether plaintiff relied on defendant's expertise in supplying a suitable product.\u00a0 971 F. Supp. 2d 1017 (2013).\n\u00a0 Considering the physical appearance of the disclaimer, the sophistication of the parties, and the circumstances of the negotiation and signing, the court declined to find that defendant disclaimed the implied warranty of fitness.\u00a0 971 F.
