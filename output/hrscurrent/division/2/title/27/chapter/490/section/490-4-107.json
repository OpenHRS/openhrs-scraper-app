[L 1965, c 208, \u00a74-106; HRS \u00a7490:4-106; am and ren L 1991, c 118, pt of \u00a74]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Where defendant argued that although there is no case law directly on point, Hawaii's uniform commercial code suggests that the State treats bank branches as separate entities, district court predicted that the Hawaii supreme court would decline to adopt the separate entity rule in this case, and therefore concluded that plaintiff's service of writ of execution on the vice-president and manager of bank's legal and custody department in Honolulu was sufficient to garnish defendant's funds in the account defendant opened at the bank branch in American Samoa.\u00a0 889 F. Supp. 2d 1244 (2012)."
