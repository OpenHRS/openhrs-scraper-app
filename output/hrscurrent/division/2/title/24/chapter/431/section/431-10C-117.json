Supp. 1420.\n\u00a0 Borrower of a vehicle cannot assert a good-faith defense without at least inquiring of the owner whether or not the vehicle is insured.\u00a0 71 H. 178, 787 P.2d 214.\n\u00a0 Where State conceded that appellant had borrowed uninsured vehicle from a friend, in order to defeat lack of knowledge defense, State was required to prove beyond reasonable doubt that appellant actually knew that the vehicle was uninsured at the time appellant was operating it.\u00a0 78 H. 86, 890 P.2d 673.\n\u00a0 As \u00a7571-1 mandates against treating juvenile adjudications as convictions, appellate court erred in holding that defendant's prior juvenile adjudication of driving without no-fault insurance constituted a conviction for purposes of applying the repeat offender sentencing provisions of this section (1993) to defendant's subsequent offense of driving without no-fault insurance.\u00a0 92 H. 521, 993 P.2d 555.\n\u00a0 Section mandates that an insurer be fined if it violates \u00a7431:10C-207 but gives the commissioner some discretion as to the amount of the fine; commissioner's imposition of $3,000 fine was not an abuse of discretion as it satisfied the statutory requirements.\u00a0 104 H. 261, 88 P.3d 196.\n\u00a0 Certified copy of a person's traffic abstract is satisfactory evidence to establish the person's prior no no-fault insurance conviction; State not required to show defendant was counseled at time of prior no no-fault insurance conviction; there was insufficient proof of defendant's prior conviction to support enhanced sentence for no no-fault insurance offense, where record disclosed no evidence to tie defendant with [person with the same name] of the traffic abstract.\u00a0 9 H. App. 516, 852 P.2d 476.\n\u00a0 Pursuant to \u00a7431:10C-117(a)(2) (1992) good faith defense and \u00a7431:10C-117(a)(2)(C) (1992) reasonable belief defense, borrower of a motor vehicle has a statutory right to reasonably believe that borrowed motor vehicle is insured.\u00a0 If one or more relevant facts reasonably required borrower to inquire, borrower then had a duty to inquire until borrower reasonably believed that motor vehicle was insured.\u00a0 10 H. App. 519, 879 P.2d 566.\n\u00a0 It was the \"obvious intention\" of the legislature to authorize the retroactive application of the part of Act 167, L 1990, that authorized the sentencing court the discretion to impose a sentence of community service instead of a fine.\u00a0 77 H. 476 (App.), 888 P.2d 376.\n\u00a0 Where defendant was sentenced pursuant to subsection (a)(2), because the district court may have been unaware of the applicability of quoted parts of \u00a7\u00a7706-641 and 706-642 and of its discretionary authority to sentence defendant to perform community service rather than to pay the fine, appellate court vacated the part of the sentence ordering defendant to pay a $1,000 fine and remanded that part for resentencing.\u00a0 77 H. 476 (App.), 888 P.2d 376.\n\u00a0 An officer who has grounds to arrest individual for driving without no-fault insurance is required to issue summons or citation in lieu of physically taking defendant to police station or court.\u00a0 78 H. 98 (App.), 890 P.2d 685.\n\u00a0 When trial court revoked driver's suspended sentence, it lacked authority to do so where the State, despite knowledge that driver had been arrested for another no-motor-vehicle-insurance charge, did not move to revoke driver's suspended sentence within the suspended sentence period, and driver was not convicted of the second citation charge until after the suspended sentence period for the first citation had already expired.\u00a0 106 H. 391 (App.), 105 P.3d 1197."
