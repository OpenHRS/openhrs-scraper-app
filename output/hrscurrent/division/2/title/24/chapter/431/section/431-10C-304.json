All providers must produce descriptions of the service provided in conformity with applicable fee schedule codes;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (B)\u00a0 If the insurer elects to deny a claim for benefits in whole or in part, the insurer shall, within thirty days, notify the claimant in writing of the denial and the reasons for the denial.\u00a0 The denial notice shall be prepared and mailed by the insurer in triplicate copies and be in a format approved by the commissioner.\u00a0 In the case of benefits for services specified in section 431:10C-103.5(a) the insurer shall also mail a copy of the denial to the provider; and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (C)\u00a0 If the insurer cannot pay or deny the claim for benefits because additional information or loss documentation is needed, the insurer shall, within the thirty days, forward to the claimant an itemized list of all the required documents.\u00a0 In the case of benefits for services specified in section 431:10C-103.5(a) the insurer shall also forward the list to the service provider;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (4)\u00a0 Amounts of benefits which are unpaid thirty days after the insurer has received reasonable proof of the fact and the amount of benefits accrued, and demand for payment thereof, after the expiration of the thirty days, shall bear interest at the rate of one and one-half per cent per month;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (5)\u00a0 No part of personal injury protection benefits paid shall be applied in any manner as attorney's fees in the case of injury or death for which the benefits are paid.\u00a0 The insurer shall pay, subject to section 431:10C-211, in addition to the personal injury protection benefits due, all attorney's fees and costs of settlement or suit necessary to effect the payment of any or all personal injury protection benefits found due under the contract.\u00a0 Any contract in violation of this provision shall be illegal and unenforceable.\u00a0 It shall constitute an unlawful and unethical act for any attorney to solicit, enter into, or knowingly accept benefits under any contract;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (6)\u00a0 Disputes between the provider and the insurer over the amount of a charge or the correct fee or procedure code to be used under the workers' compensation supplemental medical fee schedule shall be governed by section 431:10C-308.5; and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (7)\u00a0 Any insurer who violates this section shall be subject to section 431:10C-117(b) and (c). [L 1987, c 347, pt of \u00a72; am L 1992, c 124, \u00a711; am L 1993, c 6, \u00a720 and c 205, \u00a727; am L 1997, c 251, \u00a741; am L 1998, c 275, \u00a721; am L 2000, c 138, \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Where plaintiff alleged that defendant insurance company refused to pay claims for personal injury protection benefits, (1) defendant's motion to dismiss certain counts of the first amended complaint denied in part and granted in part; among other things, counts one to four of plaintiff's \"first claim\" stated a claim for relief that was authorized under this section; and (2) plaintiff's cross motion for summary judgment and adjudication or preliminary injunction denied.\u00a0 685 F. Supp. 2d 1123 (2010).\n\u00a0 Disputed issue of material fact existed as to whether or not the information requested by defendant insurer from plaintiff personal injury protection company was necessary and reasonable; defendant insurer was entitled to do some investigation to determine whether claimed benefits are appropriate and reasonable.\u00a0 732 F. Supp. 2d 1107 (2010).\n\u00a0 Section entitles motorcycle passenger to claim no-fault benefits against automobile driver's policy for passenger's injuries received in accident between driver's vehicle and motorcycle.\u00a0 81 H. 302, 916 P.2d 1203.\n\u00a0 Term \"any person\" in paragraph (1)(A)(i) includes motorcycle passengers.\u00a0 81 H. 302, 916 P.2d 1203.\n\u00a0 In light of the unambiguous mandatory language of paragraph (3)(B), an insurer is required to provide written notice of its denial--in whole or in part--of the claim for benefits; written notice to the claimant is required where the denial or partial denial relates to the treatment service and/or the charges therefor; where the denial or partial denial involves treatment services, the insurer must also provide written notice to the provider.\u00a0 109 H. 185, 124 P.3d 930 (2005).\n\u00a0 Where insurer's denial of plaintiff's claim for no-fault benefits was based upon an open question of law--whether \"the reasons\" as used in paragraph (3)(B) means \"all reasons\"--there was no bad faith on the part of insurer for not having stated all the reasons for its denial of plaintiff's claim.\u00a0 109 H. 537, 128 P.3d 850 (2006).\n\u00a0 Hawaii's no-fault legislative scheme did not establish doctor's status as a third party beneficiary as a matter of law.\u00a0 116 H. 159, 172 P.3d 471 (2007).\n\u00a0 Paragraph (1)(B) (1987) created a statutory right to survivors' loss benefits.\u00a0 88 H. 345 (App.), 966 P.2d 1071.\n\u00a0 Pursuant to paragraph (1)(B) (1987) and \u00a7431:10C-103(10)(B) (1987), upon the death of an insured, the insurer is obligated to provide the insured's survivor a survivor's loss benefit of up to either (1) $15,000 where the insured has purchased only the basic no-fault coverage, or (2) the expanded limits of no-fault benefits where the insured has contracted for it under an optional additional coverage.\u00a0 88 H. 345 (App.), 966 P.2d 1071.\n\u00a0 The plain language of paragraph (1) requires a causal connection between a motor vehicle accident and any injury for which a claim for no-fault insurance benefits is made.\u00a0 101 H. 21 (App.), 61 P.3d 532.\n\u00a0 Insurer violated the time requirements of paragraph (3)(C) (1993) when it delayed granting or denying insured's claim for no-fault benefits pending (1) receipt of answers from insured's treating physicians to insurer's questions regarding the underlying cause of the medical condition that required insured to undergo bypass surgery a few days after a motor vehicle accident, and (2) insured's undergoing two independent medical examinations; however, the commissioner wrongly concluded that insurer's violation of these time requirements procedurally barred insurer from contesting the substantive merits of insured's claim.\u00a0 101 H. 311 (App.), 67 P.3d 810.\n\u00a0 Under paragraph (5), an award of attorney's fees and costs is mandatory if a claimant prevails in a settlement or suit for no-fault benefits; and under \u00a7431:10C-211(a), an award of attorney's fees and costs may, in the exercise of a court's or the commissioner's discretion, be awarded to a nonprevailing claimant, as long as the claim is not determined to be unreasonable, fraudulent, excessive, or frivolous.\u00a0 104 H. 375 (App.), 90 P.3d 267.\n\u00a0 Paragraph (3)(B) (1993) applies to billing disputes and this section's notice requirement is triggered by a partial denial of claims in the form of reduced or partial payments by an insurer; thus, trial court erred in finding that insurer was not required to issue a formal notice of denial of benefits pursuant to paragraph (3)(B) (1993) after it made both reduced and partial payments on physician's claims.\u00a0 117 H. 477 (App.), 184 P.3d 792 (2008).\n\u00a0 Paragraph (4) (1993) is applicable when a payment due is delayed in conjunction with a billing dispute; thus, physician was entitled to interest on the balance withheld by insurer thirty days after physician submitted physician's billing statements and demand for payment; insurer was not permitted to withhold payment for an indeterminate period of time, without interest, while it sought additional information from physician.\u00a0 117 H. 477 (App.), 184 P.3d 792 (2008).\n\u00a0 The doctrine of equitable tolling cannot be applied to expand the two-year statute of limitations period in \u00a7431:10C-315 (1993) based solely on an issuer's failure to provide a formal notice of denial required pursuant to paragraph (3) (1993) in conjunction with a reduced or partial payment.\u00a0 117 H. 502 (App.), 184 P.3d 817 (2008)."
