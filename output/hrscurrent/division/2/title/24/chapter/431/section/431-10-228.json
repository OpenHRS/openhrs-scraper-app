[L 1987, c 347, pt of \u00a72]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Because Hawaii law requires every insurance policy to be subject to the general rules of contract construction, and an assignment by operation of law is merely an extension of the common law tort rule of successor liability, trial court erred in concluding that an assignment by operation of law was consistent with Hawaii's rules governing construction of insurance policies.\u00a0 117 H. 357, 183 P.3d 734 (2007).\n\u00a0 Where insurance policies contained a no assignment clause that required the consent of the insurer to bind it to any assignment made by the named insured, and named insured assignor did not obtain any of the insurers' consent prior to the assignment, assignee was not an insured under any of the insurers' policies and was therefore not owed duties to defend or indemnify by insurers.\u00a0 117 H. 357, 183 P.3d 734 (2007)."
