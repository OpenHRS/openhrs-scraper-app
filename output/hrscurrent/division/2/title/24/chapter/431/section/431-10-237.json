[L 1987, c 347, pt of \u00a72]\n\u00a0\nCross References\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Insurance policies issued to construction professionals, see \u00a7431:1-217.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Waiting period exclusion in insurance policy requiring completion of three months of continuous active service for employee to be eligible for benefits was clear and unambiguous since term \"employee\" must be read and construed according to its meaning as defined in the policy as one employed on a regular full-time permanent basis.\u00a0 72 H. 531, 827 P.2d 635.\n\u00a0 Because Hawaii law requires every insurance policy to be subject to the general rules of contract construction, and an assignment by operation of law is merely an extension of the common law tort rule of successor liability, trial court erred in concluding that an assignment by operation of law was consistent with Hawaii's rules governing construction of insurance policies.\u00a0 117 H. 357, 183 P.3d 734 (2007).\n\u00a0 Cited:\u00a0 451 F.
