and notwithstanding any other provision of law, the assets so segregated shall be transferred to a separate account with respect to which the committee shall act.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (d)\u00a0 The investments and liabilities of the account shall at all times be clearly identifiable and distinguishable from the other investments and liabilities of the insurer.\u00a0 A sale, transfer, or exchange of investments shall not be made between any of the separate accounts or between any other investment account of the company and one or more of the separate accounts, except for the purpose of:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 Conducting the business of the account in accordance with subsections (a) and (c);
