Supp. 1012.\n\u00a0 Summary judgment granted in favor of defendant with respect to any claim seeking to recover underinsured motorist benefits under automobile insurance policy, where any claim regarding underinsured motorist benefits, including the bad faith denial thereof, was barred by the limitations period set forth in this section (pre-1997 amendment).\u00a0 11 F. Supp. 2d 1204.\n\u00a0 Controlling date for the purpose of calculating the statute of limitations for plaintiff's claims of tortious breach of contract and bad faith denial of insurance benefits was two years after the last payment of motor vehicle insurance benefits; the date of plaintiff's receipt of payment, within three days of the date on which the payment was mailed, was the date on which the statute of limitations began to run.\u00a0 520 F. Supp. 2d 1212 (2007).\n\u00a0 Based on the plain language of subsection (a)(2) (1993), plaintiff's claim for no-fault benefits was not barred, where the last payment of no-fault or optional additional benefits was made not more than two years before plaintiff filed complaint against insurer.\u00a0 109 H. 537, 128 P.3d 850 (2006).\n\u00a0 Where the question of whether the underinsured motorist benefits settlement from non-party insurer would trigger the two-year statute of limitations under subsection (a) (1993) for plaintiff's claim against defendant insurer was an open question of law until this case, there was no bad faith on the part of defendant insurer for having denied plaintiff's claim for no-fault benefits on the basis of the statute of limitations.\u00a0 109 H. 537, 128 P.3d 850 (2006).\n\u00a0 Where plaintiff's negligence action was filed more than two years after insurance company made its lump sum payment to plaintiff in full satisfaction of the release, plaintiff's suit was time-barred.\u00a0 105 H. 66 (App.), 93 P.3d 1173.\n\u00a0 The doctrine of equitable tolling cannot be applied to expand the two-year statute of limitations period in this section (1993) based solely on an issuer's failure to provide a formal notice of denial required pursuant to \u00a7431:10C-304(3) (1993) in conjunction with a reduced or partial payment.\u00a0 117 H. 502 (App.), 184 P.3d 817 (2008)."
