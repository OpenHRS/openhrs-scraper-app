by the contractual obligations and related expenses of the insurer, when considered in light of the assets held by the insurer with respect to the reserves and related actuarial items, including the

of business written as well as the financial condition of the assuming reinsurer;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (5)\u00a0 Whether the insurer's operating loss in the last twelve-month period or any shorter period of time, including but not limited to net capital gain or loss, change in non-admitted assets, and cash dividends paid to shareholders, is greater than fifty per cent of the insurer's remaining surplus as regards policyholders in excess of the minimum required;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (6)\u00a0 Whether the insurer's operating loss in the last twelve-month period or any shorter period of time, excluding net capital gains, is greater than twenty per cent of the insurer's remaining surplus as regards policyholders in excess of the minimum required;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (7)\u00a0 Whether a reinsurer, obligor, or any entity within the insurer's insurance holding company system is insolvent, threatened with insolvency, or delinquent in payment of its monetary or other

(11)\u00a0 Whether management of an insurer, including officers, directors, or any other person who directly or indirectly controls the operation of the insurer, fails to possess and demonstrate the competence, fitness, and reputation deemed necessary to serve the insurer in such position;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (12)\u00a0 Whether management of an insurer has failed to respond to inquiries relative to the condition of the insurer or has furnished false and misleading information concerning an inquiry;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (13)\u00a0 Whether the insurer has failed to meet financial and holding company filing requirements in the absence of a reason satisfactory to the commissioner;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (14)\u00a0 Whether management of an insurer either has filed any false or misleading sworn financial statement, or has released any false or misleading financial statement to lending institutions or to the general public, or has made a false or misleading entry, or has omitted an entry of material amount in the books of the insurer;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (15)\u00a0 Whether the insurer has grown so rapidly and to such an extent that it lacks adequate financial and administrative capacity to meet its obligations in a timely manner;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (16)\u00a0 Whether the company has experienced, or will experience in the foreseeable future, cash flow or liquidity problems;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (17)\u00a0 Whether management has established reserves that do not comply with minimum standards established by state insurance laws, regulations, statutory accounting standards, sound actuarial principles, and standards of practice;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (18)\u00a0 Whether management persistently engages in material under reserving that results in adverse development;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (19)\u00a0 Whether transactions among affiliates, subsidiaries, or controlling persons for which the insurer receives assets or capital gains, or both, do not provide sufficient value, liquidity, or diversity to assure the insurer's ability to meet its outstanding obligations as they mature; and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (20)\u00a0 Any other finding determined by the commissioner to be hazardous to the insurer's policyholders, creditors, or the general public.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b)\u00a0 For the purposes of making a determination of an insurer's financial condition under this part, the commissioner may:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 Disregard any credit or amount receivable resulting from transactions with a reinsurer that is insolvent, impaired,

rules;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (3)\u00a0 Refuse to recognize the stated value of accounts receivable if the ability to collect receivables is highly speculative in view of the age of the account or the financial condition of the debtor; or\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (4)\u00a0 Increase the insurer's liability in an amount equal to any contingent liability, pledge, or guarantee not otherwise included if there is a substantial risk that the insurer will be called upon to meet the obligation undertaken within the next twelve-month period.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (c)\u00a0 If the commissioner determines that the continued operation of the insurer licensed to transact business in this State may be hazardous to its policyholders, its creditors, or the general public, the commissioner may, upon the commissioner's determination, issue an order requiring the insurer to:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 Reduce the total amount of present and potential liability for
