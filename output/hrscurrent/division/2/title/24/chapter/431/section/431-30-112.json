provided that a compacting state may \"opt out\" of a uniform standard as provided in this article.\u00a0 \"Opt out\" shall be defined as any action by a compacting state to decline to adopt or participate in an adopted uniform standard.\u00a0 All other rules and operating procedures, and amendments thereto, shall become effective as of the date specified in each rule, operating procedure, or amendment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (d)\u00a0 A compacting state may opt out of a uniform standard, either by legislation or by rule adopted by the insurance commissioner.\u00a0 If a compacting state elects to opt out of a uniform standard by rule, it shall:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 Give written notice to the commission no later than ten business days after the later of the adoption of the uniform standard or the state becoming a compacting state;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 Find that the uniform standard does not provide reasonable protections to the citizens of the state, given the conditions in the state.\u00a0 The commissioner shall make specific findings of fact and conclusions of law, based on a preponderance of the evidence, detailing the conditions in the state that warrant a departure from the uniform standard and determining that the uniform standard would not reasonably protect the citizens of the state.\u00a0 The commissioner shall consider and balance the following factors and find that the conditions in the state and needs of the citizens of the state outweigh:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (A)\u00a0 The intent of the legislature to participate in, and reap the benefits of, an interstate agreement to establish national uniform consumer protections for the products subject to this article; and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (B)\u00a0 The presumption that a uniform standard adopted by the commission provides reasonable protections to consumers of the relevant product.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Notwithstanding the foregoing, a compacting state may, at the time of its enactment of this compact, prospectively opt out of all uniform standards involving long-term care insurance products by expressly providing for such opt out in the enacted compact, and such an opt out shall not be treated as a material variance in the offer or acceptance of any state to participate in this compact.\u00a0 An opt out pursuant to this section shall be effective at the time of enactment of this compact by the compacting state and shall apply to all existing uniform standards involving long-term care insurance products and those subsequently adopted; and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (3)\u00a0 In accordance with the provisions of paragraph (2), this State does prospectively opt out of all uniform standards involving long-term care insurance products promulgated by the commission, as this State has previously enacted article 10H providing additional standards for federal conformity and universal availability for reciprocal beneficiary and multi-generation populace which facilitates flexibility and innovation in the development of long-term care insurance coverage.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (e)\u00a0 If a compacting state elects to opt out of a uniform standard, the uniform standard shall remain applicable in the compacting state electing to opt out until such time the opt out legislation is enacted into law or the opt out regulation becomes effective.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Once the opt out of a uniform standard by a compacting state becomes effective as provided under the laws of that state, the uniform standard shall have no further force and effect in that state unless and until the legislation or regulation implementing the opt out is repealed or otherwise becomes ineffective under the laws of the state.\u00a0 If a compacting state opts out of a uniform standard after the uniform standard has been made effective in that state, the opt out shall have the same prospective effect as provided under section 431:30-119 for withdrawals.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (f)\u00a0 If a compacting state has formally initiated the process of opting out of a uniform standard by regulation, and while the regulatory opt out is pending, the compacting state may petition the commission, at least fifteen days before the effective date of the uniform standard, to stay the effectiveness of the uniform standard in that state.\u00a0 The commission may grant a stay if it determines the regulatory opt out is being pursued in a reasonable manner and there is a likelihood of success.\u00a0 If a stay is granted or extended by the commission, the stay or extension thereof may postpone the effective date by up to ninety days, unless affirmatively extended by the commission; provided that a stay may not be permitted to remain in effect for more than one year unless the compacting state can show extraordinary circumstances that warrant a continuance of the stay, including but not limited to the existence of a legal challenge that prevents the compacting state from opting out.\u00a0 A stay may be terminated by the commission upon notice that the rulemaking process has been terminated.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (g)\u00a0 Not later than thirty days after a rule or operating procedure is adopted, any person may file a petition for judicial review of the rule or operating procedure; provided that the filing of such petition shall not stay or otherwise prevent such rule or operating procedure from becoming effective unless there is a finding that there is a substantial likelihood of success on behalf of the party filing such petition.\u00a0 The court shall give deference to the actions of the commission consistent with applicable law and shall not find the rule or operating procedure to be unlawful if such rule or operating procedure represents a reasonable exercise of the commission's authority.
