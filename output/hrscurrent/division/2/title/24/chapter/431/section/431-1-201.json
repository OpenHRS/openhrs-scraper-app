[L 1987, c 347, pt of \u00a72; am L 2012, c 34, \u00a722]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Materialman guaranteeing general contractor's performance through surety bond did not have an interest in the performance of the bond other than that of surety.\u00a0 797 F. Supp. 832.\n\u00a0 When the uncontested requirements of the managed care plan request for proposals were read alongside the text of subsection (a) defining the term \"insurance\", it was clear that the insurers had agreed to assume a risk based on a relationship with plan members--not the department of human services--and were \"undertaking to indemnify another or pay a specified amount upon determinable contingencies\"; thus, insurers were not performing their plan contracts under no licensing authority but held licenses pursuant to article 431:10A and were contracted to provide insurance services for plan members.\u00a0 126 H. 326, 271 P.3d 621 (2012).\n\u00a0 Vehicle theft registration system sold by car dealership did not constitute \"insurance\" where the system warranted against the \"defect\" that the system would fail to deter a theft and fail to aid in the recovery of the owner's vehicle, and did not warrant against the fortuitous happening of the theft itself.\u00a0 122 H. 181 (App.), 223 P.3d 246 (2009)."
