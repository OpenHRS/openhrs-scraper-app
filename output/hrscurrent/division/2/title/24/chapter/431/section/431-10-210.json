provided that nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the attachment to any such policy of an endorsement or endorsements specifically assuming coverage of loss or damage caused by nuclear reaction or nuclear radiation or radioactive contamination.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (7)\u00a0 An insurer may affix to or include in the policy a written statement that the policy does not cover loss or damage by fire to sugarcane caused by volcanic activity; provided that nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the attachment to any such policy of an endorsement or endorsements specifically assuming coverage for loss or damage by fire to sugarcane caused by volcanic activity.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (8)\u00a0 An insurer may use appropriate forms of additional contracts, riders or endorsements adding to or modifying the provisions in the standard policy or its approved equivalent, or insuring against any additional perils which may by law be the subject of insurance, or insuring against indirect or consequential loss or damage.\u00a0 Such other perils may be perils excluded from coverage in the standard policy or its approved equivalent.\u00a0 Such form of contracts, riders, and endorsements may contain provisions or stipulations inconsistent with the standard policy or its approved equivalent if such provisions and stipulations are applicable only to such additional coverage or other additional peril or perils insured against.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (g)\u00a0 A policy issued by a mutual insurer shall contain in the body of the policy the total amount for which the insured may be liable under the charter or articles of the insurer.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (h)\u00a0 In the event of any conflict between this section and other provisions of this code, this section shall govern.
