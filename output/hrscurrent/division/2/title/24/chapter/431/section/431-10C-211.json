[L 1987, c 347, pt of \u00a72; am L 1992, c 124, \u00a76; am L 1997, c 251, \u00a734]\n\u00a0\nCross References\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Vexatious litigants, see chapter 634J.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Plaintiff had a plausible claim to attorney's fees and costs under either subsection (a) or \u00a7431:10C-304(5).\u00a0 685 F. Supp. 2d 1123 (2010).\n\u00a0 Where court found that it was reasonable for plaintiff to litigate the issues raised in the action, court awarded plaintiff reasonable attorneys' fees pursuant to subsection (a).\u00a0 821 F. Supp. 632.\n\u00a0 The plain language of subsection (a) (1993) allows an award of reasonable fees and costs to any person, insured or provider, who contests a denial of no-fault benefits for injuries.\u00a0 90 H. 1, 975 P.2d 211.\n\u00a0 Where allowing insurer to seek attorney's fees under \u00a7607-14 would have contravened the attorney's fee award scheme set forth in this section, trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying insurer's motion for attorney's fees and costs.\u00a0 109 H. 537, 128 P.3d 850 (2006).\n\u00a0 The assigned claim coverage to which plaintiff was deemed entitled did not constitute a \"policy\" for purposes of subsection (a); thus, because an insurer did not deny a claim under a \"policy\", plaintiff was not entitled to attorney fees under this section.\u00a0 113 H. 246, 151 P.3d 727 (2006).\n\u00a0 Obtaining a remedy on appeal is not required in order to obtain attorney's fees under subsection (a).\u00a0 129 H. 270, 298 P.3d 1034 (2013).\n\u00a0 Petitioner's request for attorney's fees and costs was not unreasonable under subsection (a) because petitioner's underlying claim for personal injury protection benefits based on medical services rendered to the insured had been made before insured's policy limit was reached; inter alia, when petitioner first appealed, it was uncertain whether petitioner would recover on the claim under the circumstances, and, more importantly, there was favorable authority and policy supporting petitioner's position, and thus, petitioner's pursuit of appeal was not irrational or without reason.\u00a0 129 H. 270, 298 P.3d 1034 (2013).\n\u00a0 Under \u00a7431:10C-304(5), an award of attorney's fees and costs is mandatory if a claimant prevails in a settlement or suit for no-fault benefits; and under subsection (a), an award of attorney's fees and costs may, in the exercise of a court's or the commissioner's discretion, be awarded to a nonprevailing claimant, as long as the claim is not determined to be unreasonable, fraudulent, excessive, or frivolous.\u00a0 104 H. 375 (App.), 90 P.3d 267.\n\u00a0 Where insurer waived any challenge to insured's status as a real party in interest, insurance commissioner did not abuse discretion in awarding attorney's fees and costs to insured under subsection (a).\u00a0 108 H. 393 (App.), 120 P.3d 1128 (2005)."
