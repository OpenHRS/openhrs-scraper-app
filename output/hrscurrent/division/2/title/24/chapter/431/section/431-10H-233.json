subsection, as follows:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 For purposes of this subsection, attained age rating is defined as a schedule of premiums starting from the issue date which increases age at least one per cent per year prior to age fifty, and at least three per cent per year beyond age fifty;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 For purposes of this subsection, the nonforfeiture benefit shall be of a shortened benefit period providing paid-up long-term care insurance coverage after lapse.\u00a0 The same benefits (amounts and frequency in effect at the time of lapse but not increased thereafter) shall be payable for a qualifying claim, but the lifetime maximum dollars or days of benefits shall be determined as provided in paragraph (3);\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (3)\u00a0 The standard nonforfeiture credit shall be equal to one hundred per cent of the sum of all premiums paid, including the premiums paid prior to any changes in benefits.\u00a0 The insurer may offer additional shortened benefit period options, as long as the benefits for each duration equal or exceed the standard forfeiture credit for that duration.\u00a0 However, the minimum nonforfeiture credit shall not be less than thirty times the daily nursing home benefit at the time of lapse.\u00a0 In either event, the calculation of the nonforfeiture credit is subject to the limitation of subsection (k);\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (4)\u00a0 The nonforfeiture benefit shall begin not later than the end of the third year following the policy or certificate issue date; provided that the contingent

attained age rating, the nonforfeiture benefit shall begin on the earlier of:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (A)\u00a0 The end of the tenth year following the policy or

age rating; and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (6)\u00a0 Nonforfeiture credits may be used for all care and services qualifying for benefits under the terms of the policy or certificate, up to the limits specified in the policy or certificate.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (k)\u00a0 All benefits paid by the insurer while the policy or certificate is in premium paying status and in paid up status shall not exceed the maximum benefits which would be payable if the policy or certificate had remained in premium paying status.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (l)\u00a0 There shall be no difference in the minimum nonforfeiture benefits as required under this section for group and individual policies.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (m)\u00a0 The requirements set forth in this section shall become effective July 1, 2000, and shall apply as follows:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 This section shall apply to any long-term care policy issued in this State after June 30, 2000; and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 For certificates issued after June 30, 2000, under a group long-term care insurance policy as defined in paragraph (1) under the definition of \"group long-term care insurance\" in section 431:10H-104, which policy was in force on July 1, 2000, this section shall not apply;\nprovided that the provisions in subsections (c), (g), and (i) that pertain to contingent benefits for a policy with a fixed or limited premium paying period shall apply to any long-term care insurance policy or certificate issued in the State after December 31, 2007; provided further that for new certificates on a group policy as defined in section 431:10H-104, the provisions in subsections (c), (g), and (i) that pertain to contingent benefits for a policy with a fixed or limited premium paying period shall apply after July 1, 2008.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (n)\u00a0 Premiums charged for a policy or certificate containing nonforfeiture benefits or contingent benefit on lapse shall be subject to the loss ratio requirements of section 431:10H-207.5 or 431:10H-226, whichever is applicable, treating the policy as a whole.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (o)\u00a0 To determine whether contingent nonforfeiture upon lapse provisions are triggered under subsection (f) or (g), a replacing insurer that purchased or otherwise assumed a block or blocks of long-term care insurance policies from another insurer shall calculate the percentage increase based on the initial annual premium paid by the insured when the policy was first purchased from the original insurer.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (p)\u00a0 A nonforfeiture benefit for qualified long-term care insurance contracts that are level premium contracts shall be offered that meets the following requirements:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 The nonforfeiture provision shall be appropriately captioned;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 The nonforfeiture provision shall provide a benefit available in the event of a default in the payment of any premiums and shall state that the amount of the benefit may be adjusted subsequent to being initially granted only as necessary to reflect changes in claims, persistency, and interest as reflected in changes in rates for premium paying contracts approved by the commissioner for the same contract form; and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (3)\u00a0 The nonforfeiture provision shall provide at least one of the following:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (A)\u00a0 Reduced paid-up insurance; \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0
