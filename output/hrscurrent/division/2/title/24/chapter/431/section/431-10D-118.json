provided that to the extent that the company's reserve liability with regard to (A) benefits guaranteed as to amount and duration, and (B) funds guaranteed as to principal amount or stated rate of interest is maintained in any separate account, a portion of the assets of such separate account at least equal to such reserve liability shall be, except as the commissioner may otherwise approve, invested, in accordance with the laws of this State governing the investments of life insurance companies.\u00a0 The investments in such separate account or accounts shall not be taken into account in applying the investment limitations otherwise applicable to the investments of the company.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (3)\u00a0 Unless otherwise approved by the commissioner, assets allocated to a separate account shall be valued at their market value on the date of valuation, or if there is no readily available market, then as provided under the terms of the contract or the rules or other written agreement applicable to such separate account; provided that unless otherwise approved by the commissioner, a portion of the assets of such separate account equal to the company's reserve liability with regard to the guaranteed benefits and funds referred to in [subparagraphs] (A) and (B) of subsection (a)(2), if any, shall be valued in accordance with the rules otherwise applicable to the company's assets.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (4)\u00a0 Amounts allocated to a separate account in the exercise of the power granted by this section shall be owned by the company, and the company shall not be, nor hold itself out to be, a trustee with respect to such amounts.\u00a0 That portion of the assets of any such separate account equal to the reserves and other contract liabilities with respect to such account shall not be chargeable with liabilities arising out of any other business the company may conduct.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (5)\u00a0 No sale, exchange or other transfer of assets may be made by a company between any of its separate accounts or between any other investment account and one or more of its separate accounts unless, in case of a transfer into a separate account, such transfer is made solely to establish the account or to support the operation of the contracts with respect to the separate account to which the transfer is made, and unless such transfer, whether into or from a separate account, is made (A) by a transfer of cash, or (B) by a transfer of securities having a readily determinable market value, provided that such transfer of securities is approved by the commissioner.\u00a0 The commissioner may approve other transfers among such accounts, if in the commissioner's opinion, such transfers would not be inequitable.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (6)\u00a0 To the extent such company deems it necessary to comply with any applicable federal or state laws, such company, with respect to any separate account, including without limitation any separate account which is a management investment company or a unit investment trust, may provide for persons having an interest therein appropriate voting and other rights and special procedures for the conduct of the business of such account, including without limitation special rights and procedures relating to investment policy, investment advisory services, selection of independent public accountants, and the selection of a committee, the members of which need not be otherwise affiliated with such company, to manage the business of such account.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b)\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 Any variable contract providing benefits payable in variable amounts delivered or issued for delivery in this State shall contain a statement of the essential features of the procedures to be followed by the insurance company in determining the dollar amount of such variable benefits.\u00a0 Any such contract, including a group contract and any certificate in evidence of variable benefits issued thereunder, shall state that such dollar amount will vary to reflect investment experience and shall contain on its first page a statement to the effect that the benefits thereunder are on a variable basis.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 Variable contracts delivered or issued for delivery in this State may include as an incidental benefit provision for payment on death during the deferred period of an amount not in excess of the greater of the sum of the premiums or stipulated payments paid under the contract or the value of the contract at time of death.\u00a0 Any such provision shall not be deemed to be life insurance and therefore not subject to the provisions of this code governing life insurance carriers.\u00a0 A provision for any other benefit on death during the deferred period shall be subject to such insurance provisions.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (c)\u00a0 No company shall deliver or issue for delivery within this State contracts under this section unless it is licensed or organized to do a life insurance or annuity business in this State, and the commissioner is satisfied that its condition or method of operation in connection with the issuance of such contracts will not render its operation hazardous to the public or its policyholders in this State.\u00a0 In this connection, the commissioner shall consider among other things:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 The history and financial condition of the company;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 The character, responsibility and fitness of the officers and directors of the company;
