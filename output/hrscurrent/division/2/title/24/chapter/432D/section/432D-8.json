[L 1995, c 179, pt of \u00a71; am L 2001, c 185, \u00a72]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Reading \u00a7432D-1 in pari materia with this section, the Hawaii legislature did not intend to eliminate the enforcement of an implied contract between a participating provider and a health maintenance organization.\u00a0 To hold that only written contracts are valid would render the \"implied contract\" phrase in \u00a7432D-1 [definition of \"participating provider\"] meaningless because this section would bar the enforcement of such an implied contract.\u00a0 948 F. Supp. 2d 1131 (2013).\n\u00a0 While the consumer protection function of this section would prevent plaintiff, a participating provider, from seeking payment from consumer subscribers or enrollees in defendant health maintenance organization's health plans, Hawaii law does not prohibit plaintiff from seeking payment from defendant for the violation of an oral or implied contract.\u00a0 948 F. Supp. 2d 1131 (2013)."
