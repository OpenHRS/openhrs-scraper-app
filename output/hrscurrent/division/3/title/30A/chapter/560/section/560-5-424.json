    "text": "\u00a7560:5-424\u00a0 Protection of person dealing with conservator.\u00a0 (a)\u00a0 A person who assists or deals with a conservator in good faith and for value in any transaction other than one requiring a court order under section 560:5-410 or 560:5-411 is protected as though the conservator properly exercised the power.\u00a0 That a person knowingly deals with a conservator does not alone require the person to inquire into the existence of a power or the propriety of the exercise, but restrictions on powers of conservators that are endorsed on letters as provided in section 560:5-110 are effective as to third persons.\u00a0 A person who pays or delivers assets to a conservator is not responsible for their proper application.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b)\u00a0 Protection provided by this section extends to any procedural irregularity or jurisdictional defect that occurred in proceedings leading to the issuance of letters and is not a substitute for protection provided to persons assisting or dealing with a conservator by comparable provisions in other law relating to commercial transactions or to simplifying transfers of securities by fiduciaries.
