decedent\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 retained the right to the possession or enjoyment of, or to the income from, the property if and to the extent the decedent's right terminated at or continued

death, by exercise, release, lapse, in default, or otherwise, to or for the benefit of any person other than the decedent's estate or surviving spouse or reciprocal beneficiary.\u00a0 If the power is
