    "text": "\u00a7560:2-403\u00a0 Exempt property.\u00a0 In addition to the homestead allowance, the decedent's surviving spouse or reciprocal beneficiary is entitled from the estate to a value, not exceeding $10,000 in excess of any security interests therein, in household furniture, automobiles, furnishings, appliances, and personal effects.\u00a0 If there is no surviving spouse or reciprocal beneficiary, the decedent's children are entitled jointly to the same value.\u00a0 If encumbered chattels are selected and the value in excess of security interests, plus that of other exempt property, is less than $10,000 or if there is not $10,000 worth of exempt property in the estate, the spouse, reciprocal beneficiary, or children are entitled to other assets of the estate, if any, to the extent necessary to make up the $10,000 value.\u00a0 Rights to exempt property and assets needed to make up a deficiency of exempt property have priority over all claims against the estate, but the right to any assets to make up a deficiency of exempt property abates as necessary to permit earlier payment of homestead allowance and family allowance.\u00a0 These rights are in addition to any benefit or share passing to the surviving spouse, reciprocal beneficiary, or children by the decedent's will, unless otherwise provided, by intestate succession, or by way of elective share.
