Substitution may be indicated by appending to the name of the primary beneficiary the letters \"LDPS\", standing for \"lineal descendants per stirpes\".\u00a0 This designation substitutes a deceased beneficiary's descendants who survive the owner for a beneficiary who fails to so survive, the descendants to be identified and to share in accordance with the law of the beneficiary's domicile at the owner's death governing inheritance by descendants of an intestate.\u00a0 Other forms of identifying beneficiaries who are to take on one or more contingencies, and rules for providing proofs and assurances needed to satisfy reasonable concerns by registering entities regarding conditions and identities relevant to accurate implementation of registrations in beneficiary form, may be contained in a registering entity's terms and conditions.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b)\u00a0 The following are illustrations of registrations in beneficiary form which a registering entity may authorize:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 Sole owner-sole beneficiary: John S.
