provided that in every other respect, the property shall be subject to the terms of the trust instrument.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In any action concerning whether a creditor of either or both spouses may recover the debt from the trust, upon avoidance of the permitted transfer the sole remedy available to the creditor with respect to trust property treated as though it were held in tenancy by the entirety shall be an order directing the trustee to transfer the property to both spouses as tenants by the entirety.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (g)\u00a0 Subject to all of the provisions of this section and except as otherwise provided in subsection (f), upon avoidance of a qualified disposition to the extent permitted under subsection (a), the sole remedy available to the creditor shall be an order directing the trustee to transfer to the transferor the amount necessary to satisfy the transferor's debt to the creditor at whose instance the disposition has been avoided.
