and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (3)\u00a0 The trustee determines, after applying the rules in section 557A-103(a), and considering any power the trustee may have under the trust to invade principal or accumulate income, either of the following conditions exist:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (A)\u00a0 The trustee is unable to administer a trust or estate impartially based on what is fair and reasonable to all beneficiaries if no clear intention to favor one or more beneficiaries is manifested in the will or trust;

or\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (7)\u00a0 If the trustee is a beneficiary of the trust.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (d)\u00a0 If subsection (c)(5), (6), or (7) applies to a trustee and there is more than one trustee, a co-trustee to whom the provision does not apply may make the adjustment, unless the exercise of the power by the remaining trustee or trustees is clearly not permitted by the terms of the trust.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (e)\u00a0 A trustee may release the entire power conferred by subsection (a) or may release only the power to adjust from income to principal or the power to adjust from principal to income if the trustee is uncertain about whether possessing or exercising the power will cause a result described in subsection (c)(1) through (6) or if the trustee determines that possessing or exercising the power will or may deprive the trust of a tax benefit or impose a tax burden not described in subsection (c).\u00a0 The release may be permanent or for a specified period, including a period measured by the life of an individual.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (f)\u00a0 Terms of a trust that limit the power of a trustee to make an adjustment between principal and income are not contrary to this section, unless it is clear from the terms of the trust that the terms are intended to deny the trustee the power of adjustment conferred by subsection (a).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (g)\u00a0 Nothing in this section or in this chapter is intended to create or imply a duty to make an adjustment, and the trustee is not liable for not considering whether to make an adjustment or for choosing not to make an adjustment.
