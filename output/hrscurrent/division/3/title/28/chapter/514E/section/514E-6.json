[L 1980, c 186, pt of \u00a71; am L 1987, c 276, \u00a72]\n\u00a0\nAttorney General Opinions\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Time share units or plans may be created in project or building which has existing time sharing, and where project instrument does not prohibit time sharing.\u00a0 Att. Gen. Op. 81-14.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Use of term \"temporary residence\" in project's instruments does not authorize time sharing.\u00a0 70 H. 93, 762 P.2d 169.\n\u00a0 As this section, relating to time sharing, applies to a project that is not a hotel and the Maui county code section pertained to time sharing in a hotel district, the code section did not cover the same subject matter or conflict with this section; thus, the code section was not preempted by this section.\u00a0 103 H. 468, 83 P.3d 731."
