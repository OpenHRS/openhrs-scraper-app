[L 1969, c 186, \u00a74; am L 1996, c 151, \u00a72; am L 1997, c 272, \u00a73 and c 380, \u00a79]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 U.S. government immune from negligence liability under Hawaii recreational use statute (HRUS) for personal injuries suffered by plaintiff while plaintiff was using a military recreational facility, where (1) because the government did not impose a \"charge\" or \"fee\" for plaintiff to enter upon and use the recreational facility, plaintiff's use of the government's property was \"without charge\" under the statute; (2) the fact that dock on which plaintiff was injured was closed to everyone except the instructors and students of the sailing course on day of plaintiff's injury did not strip the government of its HRUS immunity; (3) plaintiff argued that legislative history indicated that HRUS was not intended to immunize businesses from liability to their business invitees, there was no need to resort to statute's legislative history in search of an exception that was clearly not included; and (4) although plaintiff may have had professional as well as personal reasons for taking the sailing course, plaintiff's alleged \"professional\" motivation did not convert plaintiff into a \"nonrecreational\" user; plaintiff's subjective intent was, in the situation, immaterial.\u00a0 181 F.3d 1064.\n\u00a0 Where, pursuant to subsection (a)(2), plaintiff was neither an invitee or licensee to whom a duty of care was owed, landowner owed no duty to prevent or warn plaintiff for plaintiff's use of landowner's land, access land, and use of public beach and ocean fronting land.\u00a0 91 H. 345 (App.), 984 P.2d 104.\n\u00a0 Cited:\u00a0 902 F.
