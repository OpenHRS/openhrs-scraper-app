[L 1969, c 186, \u00a75]\n\u00a0\nLaw Journals and Reviews\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 The Hawai`i Recreational Use Statute:\u00a0 A Practical Guide to Landowner Liability.\u00a0 22 UH L. Rev. 237.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 U.S. government immune from negligence liability under Hawaii recreational use statute (HRUS) for personal injuries suffered by plaintiff while plaintiff was using a military recreational facility, where (1) because the government did not impose a \"charge\" or \"fee\" for plaintiff to enter upon and use the recreational facility, plaintiff's use of the government's property was \"without charge\" under the statute; (2) the fact that dock on which plaintiff was injured was closed to everyone except the instructors and students of the sailing course on day of plaintiff's injury did not strip the government of its HRUS immunity; (3) plaintiff argued that legislative history indicated that HRUS was not intended to immunize businesses from liability to their business invitees, there was no need to resort to statute's legislative history in search of an exception that was clearly not included; and (4) although plaintiff may have had professional as well as personal reasons for taking the sailing course, plaintiff's alleged \"professional\" motivation did not convert plaintiff into a \"nonrecreational\" user; plaintiff's subjective intent was, in the situation, immaterial.\u00a0 181 F.3d 1064.\n\u00a0 Hotel owner not liable for swimmer's injuries since owner did not charge swimmer for access to beach and had no duty to warn swimmer of dangerous surf.\u00a0 634 F. Supp. 226.\n\u00a0 False appearance of safety created by placement of inadequate or untrained lifeguards on beach, might result in potentially dangerous condition above and beyond natural danger created by ocean currents and surf; thus, government may be held liable to extent it created, and maliciously or wilfully failed to guard or warn against, the danger.\u00a0 902 F. Supp. 1207.\n\u00a0 Given staffing, training, and equipping of lifeguards on beach on day in question, beach was not rendered more dangerous than it would be for swimmers in its natural untouched state, where training of lifeguards was adequate; thus, question whether United States knew that its actions had rendered beach more dangerous for swimmers was answered in the negative, since United States' knowledge was irrelevant; plaintiff also failed to prove wilfulness.\u00a0 916 F. Supp. 1511.\n\u00a0 Where plaintiff alleged that the United States navy received a financial benefit from the Pearl Harbor bike path when its members commuted by bicycle on the bike path, reducing the need for parking spaces at Pearl Harbor naval station, and that the city of Honolulu's bicycle registration fee constituted a \"charge\" under Hawaii recreational use statute (HRUS), the United States did not charge plaintiff to enter the bike path and the \"charge\" exception to HRUS was not applicable.\u00a0 180 F. Supp. 2d 1132."
