provided that if the equipment as it is sold to consumers cannot be used as a solar device without incorporation with other equipment, it shall be installed in place and ready to be operational to qualify as a \"solar energy device\"; provided further that \"solar energy device\" shall not include skylights or windows.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Television signal distribution\" and \"telecommunications equipment\" shall be construed in their broadest possible senses to encompass all present and future forms of communications technology.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Wind energy device\" means any new identifiable facility, equipment, apparatus, or the like which makes use of wind energy for producing electricity or reducing the use of other types of energy that are dependent upon fossil fuel for generation;
