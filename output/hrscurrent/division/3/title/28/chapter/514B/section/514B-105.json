[L 2004, c 164, pt of \u00a72; am L 2006, c 273, \u00a715]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0Condominium declaration provision that in development controversies (proceedings against respondent), petitioner must, inter alia, hire an attorney with a certain quality rating, obtain an opinion letter indicating that petitioner has a substantial likelihood of success on the merits, and impose a special litigation assessment to fund arbitration or litigation, violated subsection (a) because it imposed limitations on petitioner association of apartment owners in arbitration or litigation with respondent more restrictive than those imposed on other persons.\u00a0 130 H. 152, 307 P.3d 132 (2013).\n\u00a0 Given the types of proceedings categorized as \"operational proceedings\" by the condominium declaration in question, it could not be said that provisions in the declaration requiring approval by at least seventy-five per cent of unit owners before commencing any major litigation or arbitration and governing the funding of proceedings applied \"uniquely\" to proceedings between petitioner and respondent; moreover, as an action against respondent may be an action for damages wherein the total amount in controversy is not more than $10,000, it may also be possible for petitioner to initiate litigation against respondent that is an \"operational proceeding\", and therefore not subject to the provisions in question.\u00a0 130 H. 152, 307 P.3d 132 (2013).\n\u00a0 Condominium declaration provisions requiring approval by at least seventy-five per cent of unit owners before commencing any major litigation or arbitration and governing the funding of proceedings did not apply only to proceedings against respondent; rather the provisions applied to any proceeding other than an \"operational proceeding\" as defined by the declaration.\u00a0 Thus, the provisions did not violate subsection (a) because the provisions limited petitioner's power to institute major proceedings against any party and did not favor respondent.\u00a0 129 H. 117 (App.), 295 P.3d 987 (2013)."
