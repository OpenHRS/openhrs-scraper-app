a fact particularly obvious in Hawaii.\u00a0 In recent decades there has been growing general agreement that the wise conservation, preservation, use and management of exhaustible natural resources such as land are matters mandating an active governmental role.\u00a0 There is an intimate relationship between the monetary values accorded land in Hawaii and the stability and strength of the State's economy as a whole.\u00a0 Land values, artificially inflated by the high concentration of ownership, skew the state economy toward unnecessarily high levels.\u00a0 The pervasive and substantial contribution made to inflation by high land values creates a potential for economic instability and disruption.\u00a0 Economic inflation, instability and disruptions have real and potential damaging consequences for all members of an affected society.\u00a0 Checking inflation, improving the stability of the economy, and forestalling disadvantageous economic disruptions all are productive of general benefit to all members of the Hawaiian society.\u00a0 The sound and wise conservation, preservation, use and management of land cannot be separated from the subject of patterns of land ownership.\u00a0 To accomplish the public purposes of wisely conserving, preserving, using, and managing the land in the State requires changing present patterns of land ownership.\u00a0 Public laws, expenditures, programs, and policies which contribute to the realization of these public purposes serve a public use since they ultimately benefit the entire community.\u00a0 Changing present patterns of land ownership by allowing lessees under long-term leases of residential land to purchase in fee simple, absolute or otherwise, the land on which their homes are situated, through governmental intervention including exercise of the power of eminent domain to acquire fee simple title to such land and public financing of such purchase and such condemnation and payment through the issuance of bonds, the expenditure of general revenue funds, and the use of private funds which are at the disposal of the State, will help satisfy the pressing public necessity for a secure, strong and stable economy; \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (10)\u00a0 The State's acquisition of residential lands held in fee simple, through the exercise of the power of eminent domain, for the purposes of this chapter is for the public use and purpose of protecting the public safety, health and welfare of all people in Hawaii; \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (11)\u00a0 Inflation lessens the quality of life of all members of this afflicted society and is particularly invidious in its impact on the ninety plus per cent of the population who are in the poverty, and low through middle income groups.\u00a0 The State has limited abilities to curb inflation and, perhaps, the only useful means available is the State's power to control land values.\u00a0 There is a pressing public necessity for the State to do whatever it can to curb inflation and to keep the cost of living at a level where it is possible and manageable to provide all citizens a decent and healthful standard of life.\u00a0 The public use and purpose of providing all citizens a decent and healthful standard of life will be directly and substantially furthered by the State's acquisition of residential lands held in fee simple, through the exercise of the power of eminent domain, for the purposes of this chapter; \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (12)\u00a0 The use of the power of eminent domain to condemn the fee simple title to residential land and the payment of just compensation therefor for the purpose of making the fee simple title thereto and the use thereof available for acquisition by people who are lessees under long-term leases of such land and on which such land their homes are situated is for a public use and purpose; \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (13)\u00a0 Legislation providing to people who are lessees under long-term leases of residential land on which their homes are situated the ability to fully enjoy such land through ownership of such land in fee simple, absolute or otherwise, is for a public purpose.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b)\u00a0 It is therefore declared to be necessary and it is the purpose of this chapter to alleviate the conditions found in subsection (a) of this section by providing for the right of any person who is a lessee under a long-term lease of residential land in the State to purchase at a fair and reasonable price the fee simple title to such land, by providing for the condemnation of the fee simple title to such land and the payment of just compensation therefor by the State through the use of the power of eminent domain and by providing for the public financing of such purchase and such condemnation and payment through the issuance of bonds, the expenditure of general revenue funds, and the use of private funds which are at the disposal of the State.
