Supp. 1251.\n\u00a0 Hawaii's marriage laws (this section and article I, \u00a723 of the state constitution), which define marriage as a union between a man and a woman, are rationally related to legitimate government interests and do not violate the equal protection clause or the due process clause of the U.S. Constitution.\u00a0 884 F. Supp. 2d 1065 (2012).\n\u00a0 This section does not treat males and females differently as a class; it is gender-neutral on its face; it prohibits men and women equally from marrying a member of the same sex.\u00a0 884 F. Supp. 2d 1065 (2012).\n\u00a0 Proof of marriage without record in civil cases.\u00a0 1 H. 83; 1 H. 139; 4 H. 548; 26 H. 81.\u00a0 Presumption of validity.\u00a0 29 H. 716.\u00a0 When destroyed.\u00a0 34 H. 161; 35 H. 756.\n\u00a0 Statute as to Chinese being already married held void.\u00a0 3 H. 631.\n\u00a0 Breach of contract to marry.\u00a0 5 H. 540.\u00a0 Marriage by girl under fourteen only voidable.\u00a0 6 H. 289.\n\u00a0 No marriage without mutual consent.\u00a0 8 H. 77; 12 H. 329; 28 H. 581.\u00a0 Corroboration.\u00a0 25 H. 392, 394.\u00a0 License is prerequisite to a valid marriage.\u00a0 25 H. 397; 295 F. 636.\u00a0 License presumed from fact of marriage.\u00a0 16 H. 377; 16 H. 502.\n\u00a0 If record of marriage introduced, not necessary to prove that license had been granted or that agent had authority to grant same.\u00a0 10 H. 440.\u00a0 Or that celebrant had authority to solemnize. 10 H. 442.\n\u00a0 This section's age requirement must be read with the requirements of \u00a7572-2.\u00a0 26 H. 89.\u00a0 A property accumulated, putative marriage.\u00a0 29 H. 770, rev'd, 27 F.2d 582.\n\u00a0 Statute is presumed to be unconstitutional unless defendant, as agent of State, can show that statute's sex-based classification is justified by compelling state interests and statute is narrowly drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgments of applicant couples' constitutional rights.\u00a0 74 H. 530, 852 P.2d 44.\n\u00a0 Trial court erred in deciding that wife was entitled to prevail on her divorce claim and second husband was not entitled to prevail on his annulment claim where certified copy of judgment of divorce presented undisputed evidence that when wife married second husband, wife had prior lawful living husband and thus did not satisfy the requirement of paragraph (3).\u00a0 108 H. 459 (App.), 121 P.3d 924.\n\u00a0 Sections 580-1, 580-21, and this section must be read together; only the family court can declare void a marriage obtained by force, duress, or fraud, and it cannot do so where there has been subsequent cohabitation.\u00a0 112 H. 131 (App.), 144 P.3d 579 (2006).\n\u00a0 Cited:\u00a0 8 H. 77, 78; 44 H. 271, 273, 353 P.2d 631."
