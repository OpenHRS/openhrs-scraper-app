App. 610, 704 P.2d 940.\n\u00a0 In determining support award, court should not rely on only one or two factors to exclusion of others.\u00a0 Court abused its discretion in making child support award.\u00a0 6 H. App. 629, 736 P.2d 448.\n\u00a0 Assuming arguendo that \u00a7571-52.5 and this section embrace the same subject matter, it cannot be said as a matter of statutory construction that the former ousts the latter in the matter of past child support; subsection (d) affords the court discretion to limit past child support to a proportion of the expenses already incurred on behalf of the child that it deems just.\u00a0 98 H. 58 (App.), 41 P.3d 720.\n\u00a0 In paternity proceedings, the child support enforcement agency may not obtain a judgment for an amount of money unless and until it proves payment by the department of human services of at least that amount to or for the benefit of the child.\u00a0 105 H. 79 (App.), 93 P.3d 1186.\n\u00a0 Notwithstanding \u00a7346-37.1(b) and subsection (e), when read together, the statutes do not create a \u00a7346-37.1 \"debt due and owing to the department of human services by the natural or adoptive parent or parents who are responsible for support of such children\" in the amount calculated in accordance with the applicable child support guidelines.\u00a0 105 H. 79 (App.), 93 P.3d 1186.\n\u00a0 Mentioned:\u00a0 85 H. 108 (App.), 937 P.2d 949."
