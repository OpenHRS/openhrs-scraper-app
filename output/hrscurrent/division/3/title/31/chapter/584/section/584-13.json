[L 1975, c 66, pt of \u00a71; am L 1989, c 34, \u00a73]\n\u00a0\nRevision Note\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 In subsection (a)(2), reference to \"576D-7\" substituted for \"584-15(e)\".\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 The language of subsection (c) conditioning genetic testing on such testing being \"practicable\" refers only to the practical aspects of completing the testing and does not permit the family court to consider the \"best interest of the child\" in deciding whether to order testing in the first place.\u00a0 99 H. 1, 52 P.3d 255.\n\u00a0 In a paternity action, \u00a7584-10 and this section mandate that an informal, pre-trial hearing be held by the court to evaluate the likelihood of establishing at trial the alleged father as the natural father, to determine whether declaring paternity would be in the best interest of the child, and to recommend settlement to the parties; such a hearing is not required before a court may order genetic testing of the parties.\u00a0 88 H. 159 (App.), 963 P.2d 1135."
