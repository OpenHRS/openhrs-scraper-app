the proper supervision or return of juveniles, delinquents, and status offenders who are on probation or parole and who have absconded, escaped, or run away from supervision and control and in so doing have endangered their own safety and the safety of others.\u00a0 The compacting states also recognize that each state is responsible for the safe return of juveniles who have run away from home and in doing so have left their state of residence.\u00a0 The compacting states also recognize that Congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act, 4 United States Code section 112 (1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is the purpose of this compact, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states to:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 Ensure that the adjudicated juveniles and status offenders subject to this compact are provided adequate supervision and services in the receiving state as ordered by the adjudicating judge or parole authority in the sending state;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 Ensure that the public safety interests of the

absconded, or escaped from supervision or control, or have been accused of an offense to the state requesting their return;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (4)\u00a0 Make contracts for the cooperative institutionalization in public facilities in member states for delinquent youth needing special services;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (5)\u00a0 Provide for the effective tracking and supervision of

lines;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (9)\u00a0 Establish procedures to resolve pending charges (detainers) against juvenile offenders prior to transfer or release to the community under the terms of this compact;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (10)\u00a0 Establish a system of uniform data collection on information pertaining to juveniles subject to this compact that allows access by authorized juvenile justice

administrators;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (11)\u00a0 Monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of juveniles and initiate interventions to address and correct noncompliance;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (12)\u00a0 Coordinate training and education regarding the regulation of interstate movement of juveniles for officials involved in such activity; and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (13)\u00a0 Coordinate the implementation and operation of the compact with the interstate compact for the placement of children, the interstate compact for adult offender supervision, and other compacts affecting juveniles, particularly in those cases where concurrent or overlapping supervision issues arise.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the interstate commission created herein are the formation of public policies and therefore are public business.\u00a0 Furthermore, the compacting states shall

shall be concluded and any surplus funds shall be distributed in accordance with the bylaws.\nARTICLE XII\nSEVERABILITY AND CONSTRUCTION\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (a)\u00a0 The provisions of this compact shall be severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision is deemed unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the compact shall be enforceable.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b)\u00a0 The provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.\nARTICLE XIII\nBINDING EFFECT OF COMPACT AND OTHER LAWS\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Section A.\u00a0 Other laws.\u00a0 (a)\u00a0 Nothing in this compact prevents the enforcement of any other law of a compacting state that is not inconsistent with this compact.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b)\u00a0 All compacting states' laws other than state constitutions and other interstate compacts conflicting with this compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Section B.\u00a0 Binding effect of the compact.\u00a0 (a)\u00a0 All lawful actions of the interstate commission, including all rules and bylaws adopted by the interstate commission, are binding upon the compacting states.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b)\u00a0 All agreements between the interstate commission and the compacting states are binding in accordance with their terms.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (c)\u00a0 Upon the request of a party to a conflict over the meaning or interpretation of interstate commission actions, and upon a majority vote of the compacting states, the interstate commission may issue advisory opinions regarding the meaning or interpretation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (d)\u00a0 If any provision of this compact exceeds the constitutional limits imposed on the legislature of any compacting state, the obligations, duties, powers, or jurisdiction sought to be conferred by the provision upon the interstate commission shall be ineffective and the obligations, duties, powers, or jurisdiction shall remain in the compacting state and shall be exercised by the agency thereof to which the obligations, duties, powers, or jurisdiction are delegated by law in effect at the time this compact becomes effective.
