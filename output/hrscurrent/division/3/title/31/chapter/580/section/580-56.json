App. 214, 832 P.2d 280.\n\u00a0 In light of subsection (a), when the divorce decree ordered husband to transfer a specified value of husband's stocks and funds to wife, that specified value of husband's stocks and funds, for purposes of subsection (d), was no longer a part of husband's personal estate.\u00a0 108 H. 504 (App.), 122 P.3d 284.\n\u00a0 Subsection (d) does not divest the family court of jurisdiction to issue further property distribution orders in response to an order of remand from an appellate court of a timely-decided property division order under \u00a7580-47(b); upon remand and absent extraordinarily compelling circumstances, the family court retains jurisdiction for no more than one year after the date that the case is lodged again on remand in order to redivide and redistribute the parties\u0092 property to the extent required on remand.\u00a0 127 H. 346 (App.), 279 P.3d 11 (2012).\u00a0 \n\u00a0 Where the divorce decree was filed on July 17, 2006 and the decision, entered on June 18, 2007, did not merely state findings of fact and conclusions of law, but also contained the order which divided the parties\u0092 property and addressed all remaining claims, the family court fully and finally divided the parties\u0092 assets within one year of the decree in compliance with subsection (d).\u00a0 127 H. 346 (App.), 279 P.3d 11 (2012).\n\u00a0 Cited:\u00a0 21 H. 264, 266."
