[L 2012, c 267, pt of \u00a73; am L Sp 2013 2d, c 1, \u00a78]\n\u00a0\nCross References\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Marriage, exemption for religious organizations, see \u00a7572-12.2.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Complaint challenging the constitutionality of the civil unions law was moot because Act 267, L 2012, amended the civil unions law retroactively to add an immunity provision [this section], which provided immunity for religious organizations that refused to make their facilities available for solemnizing civil unions.\u00a0 Granting leave to amend complaint would be futile because the action would remain nonjusticiable; plaintiffs did not demonstrate that they had standing or that the action was ripe.\u00a0 903 F. Supp. 2d 1024 (2012)."
