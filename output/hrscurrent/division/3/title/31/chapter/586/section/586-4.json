may also restrain the party or parties to whom it is directed from contacting, threatening, or physically abusing the applicant's family or household members; and may enjoin or restrain both parties from taking, concealing, removing, threatening, physically abusing, or otherwise disposing of any animal identified to the court as belonging to a household, until further order of the court.\u00a0 The order shall not only be binding upon the parties to the action, but also upon their officers, agents, servants, employees, attorneys, or any other persons in active concert or participation with them.\u00a0 The order shall enjoin the respondent or person to be restrained from performing any combination of the following acts:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 Contacting, threatening, or physically abusing the protected party;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 Contacting, threatening, or physically abusing any person residing at the protected party's residence;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (3)\u00a0 Entering or visiting the protected party's residence;
