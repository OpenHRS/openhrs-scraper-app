[L 1982, c 123, pt of \u00a72; am L 1983, c 186, \u00a71; am L 1987, c 315, \u00a73; am L 1992, c 290, \u00a73; am L 1998, c 172, \u00a73; am L 2011, c 85, \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Hawaii violation for breach of a protective order is not similar to contempt of court for sentencing purposes.\u00a0 631 F.3d 1021 (2011).\n\u00a0 The constitutional right to discipline is inherent in the right to care, custody, and control of one's children; due process requires the State provide meaningful standards to guide the application of its laws; the appropriate standard for family courts to apply in contested chapter 586 show cause hearings is whether the parent's discipline is reasonably related to the purpose of safeguarding or promoting the welfare of the minor; in applying such a standard, circumstances, including factors such as the nature of the misbehavior, the child's age and size, and nature and propriety of the force used, should also guide the courts in this State.\u00a0 126 H. 294, 270 P.3d 1024 (2012).\n\u00a0 Although the fifteen-day time period for holding a show-cause hearing in subsection (b) is directory, the fifteen-day time period is not permissive, and the family court is obligated to hold a show-cause hearing on a temporary restraining order (TRO) within fifteen days from the date the TRO is granted (where service has been effected) unless there is a substantial reason amounting to good cause for a delay.\u00a0 122 H. 485 (App.), 228 P.3d 365 (2010).\n\u00a0 Subsection (b)'s fifteen-day time period for holding a show-cause hearing is directory; thus, subsection (b) did not compel dissolution of the temporary restraining order (TRO) against respondent and the family court erred in ruling that subsection (b) required the dissolution of the TRO against respondent because a show-cause hearing was not held within fifteen days of the issuance of the TRO.\u00a0 122 H. 485 (App.), 228 P.3d 365 (2010)."
