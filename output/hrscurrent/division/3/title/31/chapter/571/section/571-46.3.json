    "text": "\u00a7571-46.3\u00a0 Grandparents' visitation rights; petition; notice; order.\u00a0 A grandparent or the grandparents of a minor child may file a petition with the court for an order of reasonable visitation rights.\u00a0 The court may award reasonable visitation rights provided that the following criteria are met:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 This State is the home state of the child at the time of the commencement of the proceeding; and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 Reasonable visitation rights are in the best interests of the child.\nNo hearing for an order of reasonable visitation rights under this section shall be had unless each of the living parents and the child's custodians shall have had due notice, actual or constructive, of the allegations of the petition and of the time and place of the hearing thereof.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An order made pursuant to this section shall be enforceable by the court, and the court may issue other orders to carry out these enforcement powers if in the best interests of the child. [L 1993, c 166, \u00a71; am L 1998, c 20, \u00a72]\n\u00a0\nRules of Court\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Pleadings, see Hawaii Family Court Rules, part A(III).\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 The \"best interests of the child\" standard in paragraph (2) requires the family court to give \"special weight\" to (i.e., uphold a rebuttable presumption in favor of) the visitation decisions of a custodial parent whose fitness has not been challenged; thus, the family court erred to the extent that it relied on Troxel to invalidate this section (2003); however, as a \"harm to the child\" standard was constitutionally required and could not be read into this section without making a substantive amendment to the statute, this section, as written, was unconstitutional.\u00a0 116 H. 323, 172 P.3d 1067.\n\u00a0 Article XII, \u00a77 of the Hawaii constitution and/or \u00a71-1 do not authorize for native Hawaiian grandparents any more visitation rights than \u00a7571-46(7) and this section authorize for all grandparents, native and non-native Hawaiian.\u00a0 112 H. 113 (App.), 144 P.3d 561.\n\u00a0 Discussed:\u00a0 88 H. 68 (App.), 961 P.2d 1162."
