Jurisdiction, custody of children.\u00a0 49 H. 20, 29-31, 407 P.2d 885.\n\u00a0 Child's right to support in action against parent.\u00a0 49 H. 200, 412 P.2d 638.\n\u00a0 Family court has jurisdiction to determine custodial and visitation rights of the natural father of illegitimate child.\u00a0 56 H. 462, 541 P.2d 13.\n\u00a0 Court retains \"exclusive original jurisdiction\" where jurisdiction is not validly waived.\u00a0 61 H. 185, 599 P.2d 298.\n\u00a0 Section 571-48 applies only to minors actually adjudicated under this section, and placement of a minor, prior to adjudication, is dealt with under \u00a7571-32.\u00a0 84 H. 41, 928 P.2d 883.\n\u00a0 The family court may adjudicate and punish status offenders under paragraph (1) for criminal contempt based on violations of court orders of protective supervision, provided the minor is given sufficient notice to comply, the court considers less restrictive alternatives, and contact between the status offender and juvenile delinquents convicted of other crimes are kept to a minimum.\u00a0 96 H. 73, 26 P.3d 562.\n\u00a0 As claim that health department was legally obligated to pay for child's services at private residential treatment center arose under the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and child did not pursue the remedies available under the federal act to establish health department's obligation to pay for the services, family court lacked jurisdiction to order the department to pay for the services.\u00a0 96 H. 272, 30 P.3d 878.\n\u00a0 Although the reconsideration provision of \u00a7571-54 for the right to appeal an order or decree entered in a proceeding based on paragraph (1), (2), (6), or (9) is conditioned upon the filing of a timely motion for reconsideration, and prosecution appealed without filing such a motion, where motion to suppress, opposing memorandum, transcript and order appeared to be parties' and family court's complete record of suppression matter and neither party asserted on appeal that \u00a7571-54 had been violated, appellate court chose to address merits of appeal.\u00a0 104 H. 403, 91 P.3d 485.\n\u00a0 As district family court proceedings under paragraph (1) concerning juvenile law violators are considered to be noncriminal proceedings, prosecution's appeal of family court order was not authorized by \u00a7641-13(7).\u00a0 104 H. 403, 91 P.3d 485.\n\u00a0 The district family courts lack subject matter jurisdiction, under any circumstances, to order the department of education to alter a child's grade placement.\u00a0 105 H. 38, 93 P.3d 1145.\n\u00a0 Where minor was adjudicated for alleged law violations without the statutorily required recommendation of a qualified physician or psychologist, pursuant to \u00a7571-44, and without the constitutional protections that apply to proceedings conducted under paragraph (1) jurisdiction, the family court erred in proceeding under paragraph (2) jurisdiction based on the material allegations of the amended petition filed against minor.\u00a0 123 H. 184, 231 P.3d 457 (2010).\n\u00a0 No reversible error is committed where the family court employs rules from the HRPP in adjudicating \u00a7571-11(1) proceedings, if the otherwise correct use of such rules does not conflict with judicial administration of chapter 571 and is not unfairly prejudicial to minor(s) involved.\u00a0 79 H. 265 (App.), 900 P.2d 1332.\n\u00a0 A family court may exercise jurisdiction over a child in a paragraph (3) divorce case while a paragraph (9) case involving the same child is on appeal.\u00a0 81 H. 91 (App.), 912 P.2d 588.\n\u00a0 While a family court has jurisdiction over custody of two children in a paragraph (9) case, a family court may also assert jurisdiction over the custody of those same children in a paragraph (3) divorce case.\u00a0 81 H. 91 (App.), 912 P.2d 588.\n\u00a0 Family court properly exercised jurisdiction over person alleged to have committed acts which would have constituted violations of state law before person was eighteen years old.\u00a0 86 H. 517 (App.), 950 P.2d 701.\n\u00a0 Minor was properly adjudicated a law violator in a criminal contempt proceeding for failing to comply with rules of a protective supervision order.\u00a0 96 H. 255 (App.), 30 P.3d 269.\n\u00a0 Family court orders assessing father's attorney fees and costs against mother were orders entered in a proceeding based upon paragraph (9) that fell within the ambit of \u00a7571-54 and were expressly excluded by the Hawaii family court rules, rule 59(e) from its ambit.\u00a0 113 H. 478 (App.), 155 P.3d 661 (2007).\n\u00a0 Any person who is alleged, pursuant to paragraph (1), to have committed an act prior to achieving eighteen years of age which would constitute a violation of law (as described in this statute) shall be advised of his or her right to testify, and in every adjudication under paragraph (1) in which the accused minor does not testify, a family court must engage in a Tachibana-like colloquy to obtain an on-the-record waiver of that right.\u00a0 121 H. 92 (App.), 214 P.3d 1082 (2009).\n\u00a0 Parents have standing throughout a juvenile's proceeding conducted pursuant to paragraph (1).\u00a0 121 H. 92 (App.), 214 P.3d 1082 (2009)."
