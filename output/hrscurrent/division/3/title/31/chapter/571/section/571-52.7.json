[L 1994, c 247, \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Family court erred in limiting plaintiff ex-wife's award of attorney's fees to a lodestar amount with no consideration given to a contingent fee enhancement; this section is a fee-shifting statute designed to \"attract competent counsel\" and a contingent fee enhancement should have at least been considered by the family court. 97 H. 160 (App.), 34 P.3d 1059."
