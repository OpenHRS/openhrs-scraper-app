App. 161, 795 P.2d 294.\n\u00a0 Father's right to custody was terminated and children were placed in the custody of foster parents.\u00a0 8 H. App. 377, 805 P.2d 1215.\n\u00a0 Nothing in subsection (a) or chapter 587 indicates that when the department of human services and the affected parents settle a termination proceeding, they may do so only by resorting to a subsection (a) proceeding.\u00a0 90 H. 200 (App.), 978 P.2d 166.\n\u00a0 Trial court erred in applying clear and convincing evidence standard of proof in deciding whether natural father was an unfit parent in a petition by grandparents for guardianship of the person of their grandson, as a guardianship of the person of a minor is neither absolute nor irrevocable, and the heightened standard of proof attendant upon those attributes of a termination of parental rights did not apply.\u00a0 106 H. 75 (App.), 101 P.3d 684."
