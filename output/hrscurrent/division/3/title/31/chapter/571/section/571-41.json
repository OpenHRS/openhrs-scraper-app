provided that:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 Upon request by a party, hearings initiated pursuant to chapter 587A may be opened to the public if a judge determines that doing so would be in the best interests of the child;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 Parties involved in hearings initiated pursuant to chapter 587A shall be allowed to be accompanied by an adult advocate to provide support, unless the court finds that the presence of the advocate would not be in the best interests of the child.\u00a0 The advocate need not be a licensed attorney.\u00a0 The State shall not be required to pay, directly or through reimbursement, for any fees, costs, or expenses related to the advocate.\u00a0 No person shall act as an advocate who has an interest in the matter beyond the protection of the child and the healing and rehabilitation of the family; and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (3)\u00a0 The victim of the alleged violation and all other witnesses who are younger than eighteen years of age shall be entitled to have parents, guardians, or one other adult and may have an attorney present while testifying at or otherwise attending a hearing initiated pursuant to section 571-11(1) or 571-11(2).\nPrior to the start of a hearing, the parents, guardian, or legal custodian, and, when appropriate, the child, the child victim, or witness shall be notified of the right to be represented by counsel and the right to remain silent.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (c)\u00a0 Findings of fact by the judge or district family judge of the validity of the allegations in the petition shall be based upon a preponderance of evidence admissible in the trial of civil cases except for petitions alleging the court's jurisdiction under section 571-11(1) which shall require proof beyond a reasonable doubt in accordance with rules of evidence applicable to criminal cases; provided that no child who is before the court under section 571-11(1) shall have admitted against the child any evidence in violation of the child's rights secured under the constitution of the United States or the State of Hawaii.\u00a0 In the discretion of the judge or district family judge the child may be excluded from the hearing at any time.\u00a0 When more than one child is alleged to have been involved in the same act, the hearing may be held jointly for the purpose of making a finding as to the allegations in the petition and then shall be heard separately for the purpose of disposition except in cases where the children involved have one common parent.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (d)\u00a0 In the disposition part of the hearing any relevant and material information, including information contained in a written report, study, or examination, and the results of a risk and needs assessment of the child conducted pursuant to section 571-45, shall be admissible, and may be relied upon to the extent of its probative value; provided that the maker of the written report, study, or examination shall be subject to both direct and cross-examination upon demand and when the maker is reasonably available.\u00a0 The disposition shall be based only upon the admitted evidence, and findings adverse to the child as to disputed issues of fact shall be based upon a preponderance of such evidence.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (e)\u00a0 Upon a final adverse disposition, if the parent or guardian is without counsel the court shall inform the parent or guardian of the parent's or guardian's right to appeal as provided for in section 571-54.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (f)\u00a0 The judge, or the senior judge if there is more than one, may by order confer concurrent jurisdiction on a district court created under chapter 604 to hear and dispose of cases of violation of traffic laws or ordinances by children, provision to the contrary in section 571-11 or elsewhere notwithstanding.\u00a0 The exercise of jurisdiction over children by district courts shall, nevertheless, be considered noncriminal in procedure and result in the same manner as though the matter had been adjudicated and disposed of by a family court.
