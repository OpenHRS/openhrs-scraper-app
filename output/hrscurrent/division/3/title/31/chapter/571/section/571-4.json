[L 1965, c 232, pt of \u00a71; Supp, \u00a7333-4; HRS \u00a7571-4]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Even assuming that, for purposes of \u00a7571-14, defendant did not have physical custody of complainant during the times of the alleged offenses, and the family court was, therefore, without jurisdiction over those counts of the indictment, the judge, in the judge's capacity as a circuit court judge, properly exercised jurisdiction over those counts under this section.\u00a0 103 H. 214, 81 P.3d 394.\n\u00a0 Where judge, at the time judge entered the family court orders purporting to void the estate documents, was a district judge appointed under \u00a7571-8, not a circuit judge sitting by designation in family court under this section, the judge lacked original jurisdiction over guardianships of the property under \u00a7560:5-102 as it stood prior to the 1996 amendments to the Hawaii uniform probate code.\u00a0 110 H. 8, 129 P.3d 511."
