or\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (3)\u00a0 The safety of the community requires that the person be subject to judicial restraint for a period extending beyond the person's minority.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b)\u00a0 The court may waive jurisdiction and order a minor or adult held for criminal proceedings if, after a full investigation and hearing, the court finds that:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 The person during the person's minority, but on or after the person's fourteenth birthday, is alleged to have committed an act that would constitute a felony if committed by an adult and either:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (A)\u00a0 The act resulted in serious bodily injury to a victim;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (B)\u00a0 The act would constitute a class A felony if committed by an adult; or\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (C)\u00a0 The person has more than one prior adjudication for acts that would constitute felonies if committed by an adult; and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 There is no evidence the person is committable to an institution for individuals with intellectual disabilities or the mentally ill.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (c)\u00a0 The factors to be considered in deciding whether jurisdiction should be waived under subsection (a) or (b) are as follows:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 The seriousness of the alleged offense;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 Whether the alleged offense was committed in an aggressive, violent, premeditated, or wilful manner;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (3)\u00a0 Whether the alleged offense was against persons or against property, greater weight being given to offenses against persons, especially if personal injury resulted;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (4)\u00a0 The desirability of trial and disposition of the entire offense in one court when the minor's associates in the alleged offense are adults who will be charged with a crime;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (5)\u00a0 The sophistication and maturity of the minor as determined by consideration of the minor's home, environmental situation, emotional attitude, and pattern of living;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (6)\u00a0 The record and previous history of the minor, including previous contacts with the family court, other law enforcement agencies, courts in other jurisdictions, prior periods of probation to the family court, or prior commitments to juvenile institutions;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (7)\u00a0 The prospects for adequate protection of the public and the likelihood of reasonable rehabilitation of the minor (if the minor is found to have committed the alleged offense) by the use of procedures, services, and facilities currently available to the family court; and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (8)\u00a0 All other relevant matters.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (d)\u00a0 The court may waive jurisdiction and order a minor or adult held for criminal proceedings if, after a full investigation and hearing, the court finds that:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 The person during the person's minority is alleged to have committed an act that would constitute murder in the first degree or second degree or attempted murder in the first degree or second degree if committed by an adult; and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 There is no evidence the person is committable to an institution for individuals with intellectual disabilities or the mentally ill.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (e)\u00a0 Transfer of a minor for criminal proceedings terminates the jurisdiction of the court over the minor with respect to any subsequent acts that would otherwise be within the court's jurisdiction under section 571-11(1) and thereby confers jurisdiction over the minor to a court of competent criminal jurisdiction.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (f)\u00a0 If criminal proceedings instituted under subsection (a), (b), or (d) result in an acquittal or other discharge of the minor involved, no petition shall be filed thereafter in any family court based on the same facts as were alleged in the criminal proceeding.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (g)\u00a0 A minor shall not be subject to criminal prosecution based on the facts giving rise to a petition filed under this chapter, except as otherwise provided in this chapter.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (h)\u00a0 Where the petition has been filed in a circuit other than the minor's residence, the judge, in the judge's discretion, may transfer the case to the family court of the circuit of the minor's residence.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (i)\u00a0 When a petition is filed bringing a minor before the court under section 571-11(1) and (2), and the minor resides outside of the circuit, but within the State, the court, after a finding as to the allegations in the petition, may certify the case for disposition to the family court having jurisdiction where the minor resides.\u00a0 Thereupon, the court shall accept the case and may dispose of the case as if the petition was originally filed in that court.\u00a0 Whenever a case is so certified, the certifying court shall forward to the receiving court certified copies of all pertinent legal and social records.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (j)\u00a0 If the court waives jurisdiction pursuant to subsection (b) or (d), the court also may waive its jurisdiction with respect to any other felony charges arising from the same episode to the charge for which the minor was waived.

App. 226, 617 P.2d 826.\n\u00a0 Purpose of family court waiver hearing is not to determine whether minor committed offense alleged or even to determine probable cause.\u00a0 Presumption that charges are true does not violate due process.\u00a0 1 H. App. 243, 617 P.2d 830.\n\u00a0 Where family court has considered all the factors in its determination to waive and there is no manifest abuse of discretion, appellate court is not required to determine or question the weight attributed to the various factors.\u00a0 1 H. App. 301, 618 P.2d 1150.\n\u00a0 A minor who is \"treatable\" may still be waived\u00a0 for the \"safety of the community\".\u00a0 1 H. App. 611, 623 P.2d 1262.\n\u00a0 Minor whose acts are offenses against property may still pose a threat to the \"safety of the community\".\u00a0 1 H. App. 611, 623 P.2d 1262.\n\u00a0 Where family court declined to waive jurisdiction over person, deciding that safety of community did not require that person continue under judicial restraint for period extending beyond person's minority and that no court could commit person to adult correctional facility, but thereafter committed person to adult correctional facility, court unlawfully violated its prior order declining to waive jurisdiction.\u00a0 86 H. 517 (App.), 950 P.2d 701.\n\u00a0 Family court did not err at hearing on petition to waive family court jurisdiction over defendant when it admitted into evidence a police report without affording defendant the opportunity to call, confront and cross-examine the percipient witnesses to the offense named in the police report where defendant did not show what defendant's cross-examination of the witnesses might have revealed; thus, no abuse of discretion in family court waiving jurisdiction over defendant.\u00a0 107 H. 259 (App.), 112 P.3d 745."
