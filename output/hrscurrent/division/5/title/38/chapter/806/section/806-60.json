[L 1979, c 89, \u00a72]\n\u00a0\nCross References\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 See Const. art. I, \u00a714.\n\u00a0\nRules of Court\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Jury of less than twelve, see HRPP rule 23(b).\n\u00a0\nAttorney General Opinions\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Proposed amendment to section did not require constitutional amendment because jury comprised of six members in cases involving non-serious crimes tracked language of \u00a714 of article I of the state constitution; however, definition of \"serious crimes\" as exclusively crimes for which the defendant faces possibility of imprisonment of at least six months, was inconsistent with the principle that crimes that do not carry the possibility of this specific term of imprisonment may nonetheless constitute \"serious crimes\" which trigger constitutional right to jury trial.\u00a0 Att. Gen. Op. 97-2.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Where the misdemeanor offense charged against defendant of assault in the third degree under \u00a7707-712 was not amended to a petty misdemeanor, and defendant had demanded defendant\u0092s right to a jury trial pursuant to this section prior to leaving the courtroom, the district court lacked jurisdiction to proceed to trial; defendant\u0092s conviction for third degree assault in the course of a mutual affray thus vacated and remanded for a new trial.\u00a0 128 H. 479, 291 P.3d 377 (2013).\n\u00a0 Family court failed to ensure that defendant's waiver of defendant's right to a jury trial was voluntary, where defendant failed to sign defendant's initials next to the paragraph addressing voluntariness on the written waiver form and none of the family court's questions were directed towards determining the voluntariness of defendant's waiver.\u00a0 132 H. 1, 319 P.3d 1009 (2014).\n\u00a0 Discussed:\u00a0 76 H. 360, 878 P.2d 699 (1994)."
