App. 148, 861 P.2d 759 (1993).\n\u00a0 Where the indictment alleges that a \"dangerous instrument\" was used in the commission of the offense charged so as to allow proof that a \"firearm\" was used, the possibility exists that the defendant is not eligible for a deferred acceptance of no contest (DANC) plea; in such cases, if prior to the court's decision on the defendant's motion for a DANC plea the court is informed that the \"dangerous instrument\" was a \"firearm\", the defendant is not eligible for, and the court is not authorized to enter, a DANC plea.\u00a0 101 H. 65 (App.), 62 P.3d 628 (2002).\n\u00a0 Mentioned:\u00a0 74 H. 75, 837 P.2d 776 (1992)."
