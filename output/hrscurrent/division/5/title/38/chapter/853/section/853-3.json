[L 1976, c 154, pt of \u00a72; am L 1983, c 290, \u00a74]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Because a court's course of action following revocation of a deferred acceptance of guilty plea is expressly set forth in this section, no need or justification arises for resort to any other statute, such as \u00a7706-625(5).\u00a0 93 H. 362, 3 P.3d 1239 (2000).\n\u00a0 Section 706-625(5), which permits a trial court on revocation of probation to impose any sentence that might have originally been imposed at the time of conviction, does not apply to the sentencing procedure attendant to revocation of a deferred acceptance of guilty plea, which is already specifically governed by this section.\u00a0 93 H. 362, 3 P.3d 1239 (2000).\n\u00a0 No abuse of discretion where family court concluded that defendant's refusal to take polygraph examination, resulting in defendant's termination from sex offender treatment program, constituted a violation of the terms and conditions of the deferred acceptance of nolo contendere plea order, warranting that it be set aside.\u00a0 92 H. 289 (App.), 990 P.2d 1171 (1999)."
