[L 1976, c 154, pt of \u00a72; am L 1979, c 147, \u00a71 and c 155, \u00a71; am L 1980, c 232, \u00a742; am L 1983, c 290, \u00a72(1), (2); gen ch 1985; am L 1988, c 184, \u00a71; am L 2000, c 115, \u00a73; am L 2012, c 295, \u00a72]\n\u00a0\nNote\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 The 2012 amendment shall not apply to any defendant granted a deferred acceptance of guilty or no contest plea before July 9, 2012.\u00a0 L 2012, c 295, \u00a73.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Deferred acceptance of guilty plea constitutes a form of punishment under the Assimilated Crimes Act.\u00a0 866 F.2d 315 (1989).\n\u00a0 Procedure (under earlier program) does not impose an impermissible burden on exercise of right of trial by jury.\u00a0 58 H. 304, 568 P.2d 1194 (1977).\n\u00a0 Under procedures established before enactment of this section, it was held that a motion for DAG plea was not seasonably made after a plea of not guilty and a trial resulting in a finding of guilt.\u00a0 58 H. 412, 570 P.2d 1323 (1977).\n\u00a0 Denial of motion for deferred acceptance of guilty plea is within discretion of trial court.\u00a0 59 H. 562, 584 P.2d 126 (1978).\n\u00a0 Deferred acceptance of guilty plea is not a conviction and may not be used for impeachment purposes.\u00a0 62 H. 259, 614 P.2d 386 (1980).\n\u00a0 Did not limit trial court's power to accept nolo contendere plea to cases where plea is entered before trial begins.\u00a0 66 H. 364, 662 P.2d 212 (1983).\n\u00a0 Deferred acceptance of guilty and no contest pleas are not appealable.\u00a0 69 H. 438, 746 P.2d 568 (1987).\n\u00a0 The tolling provisions under \u00a7706-627 apply to deferral periods pursuant to a deferred acceptance of guilty plea.\u00a0 92 H. 322, 991 P.2d 832 (2000).\n\u00a0 A conditional plea under HRPP rule 11(a)(2) is inconsistent with the granting of a deferred acceptance of guilty plea pursuant to this chapter; defendant's appeal from trial court's order granting motion for deferred plea did not provide a jurisdictional basis for review of an adverse pretrial suppression order purportedly preserved by the trial court's allowance of defendant's conditional plea.\u00a0 95 H. 309, 22 P.3d 588 (2001).\n\u00a0 Where defendant entered no contest plea after trial commenced, pursuant to subsection (a)(1), defendant was not eligible for plea deferral; only available remedy to defendant was to permit defendant to withdraw plea.\u00a0 95 H. 398, 23 P.3d 733 (2001).\n\u00a0 In connection with the conditions from \u00a7706-624 that are incorporated by reference in this section, the \"provision\" in \u00a7706-624(3) that requires a defendant who is granted probation to be given a written copy of the conditions, must necessarily apply to a defendant granted a deferred acceptance of guilty plea, who must adhere to such similar conditions.\u00a0\u00a0 118 H. 15, 185 P.3d 200 (2008).\n\u00a0 Where State did not file a written motion to revoke defendant's deferred acceptance of guilty plea, the probationary period was not tolled; thus, as the deferment period had expired two months earlier, trial court lacked jurisdiction to revoke defendant's deferred acceptance of guilty plea.\u00a0 118 H. 15, 185 P.3d 200 (2008).\n\u00a0 Where the State promised as a condition of the plea agreement to \"take no position\" on petitioner's deferred acceptance of no contest plea (DANCP) motion but prosecutor's comments directly addressed the issues pertinent to the motion, the terms of the agreement were not fulfilled and petitioner was denied petitioner's due process rights; because this contravention of petitioner's DANCP plea agreement violated petitioner's fundamental rights and resulted in manifest injustice, this was plain error under HRPP rule 52, the error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and sentencing by another judge was the proper remedy.\u00a0 122 H. 92, 223 P.3d 157 (2010).\n\u00a0\u00a0Granting or denial of motion for deferred acceptance of guilty plea is within discretion of trial court and will not be disturbed unless there has been manifest abuse.\u00a0 1 H. App. 157, 616 P.2d 226 (1980).\n\u00a0 This chapter does not prohibit trial court's inherent power to grant or deny deferred acceptance of nolo contendere pleas.\u00a0 1 H. App. 602, 623 P.2d 892 (1981).\n\u00a0 Subsection (a)(1)'s requirement that defendant plead guilty \"prior to commencement of trial\" means that it be done prior to commencement of first trial; defendant's plea of guilty after first trial and before new trial did not satisfy that requirement.\u00a0 10 H. App. 31, 859 P.2d 1380 (1993).\n\u00a0 In light of \u00a7706-624(n), family court was authorized to require defendant to undergo polygraph testing as a reasonable condition of the granting of defendant's deferred acceptance of nolo contendere plea under this section.\u00a0 92 H. 289 (App.), 990 P.2d 1171 (1999).\n\u00a0 Mentioned:\u00a0 74 H. 75, 837 P.2d 776 (1992); 10 H. App. 148, 861 P.2d 759 (1993)."
