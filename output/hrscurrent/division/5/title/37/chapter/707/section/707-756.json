[L 2002, c 200, pt of \u00a71; am L 2006, c 80, \u00a72; am L 2008, c 80, \u00a73]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0Requiring the use of a computer or other electronic device to travel to the agreed-upon meeting place at the agreed-upon time would render the statute absurd in meaning; and requiring the use of a computer or other electronic device to agree to meet with the minor would render the statute structurally incoherent as a whole.\u00a0 With respect to the computer-use requirement, the State was required to prove that defendant used a computer or electronic device only to communicate with \"Chyla\".\u00a0 131 H. 379, 319 P.3d 298 (2013).\n\u00a0\u00a0This section does not concern interstate commerce, and therefore, scrutiny under the commerce clause was not appropriate.\u00a0 Assuming, arguendo, that this section warranted commerce clause scrutiny, this section does not violate the dormant commerce clause.\u00a0 131 H. 312 (App.), 318 P.3d 602 (2013).\n\u00a0 This section was not unconstitutionally overbroad and/or vague as applied to defendant, and the circuit court did not err in denying defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment on that basis where, among other things, when the statute was read as a whole, it was clear that only criminal conduct was proscribed and the statute plainly criminalized conduct that is coupled with the intent to promote or facilitate the commission of a felony.\u00a0 131 H. 312 (App.), 318 P.3d 602 (2013).\n\u00a0 Trial court did not err in rejecting defendant's proffered reason for requesting the withdrawal of defendant's second guilty plea on the ground that defendant had not been aware of a potentially meritorious defense that the State was unable to prove that defendant had traveled to the agreed upon meeting place as required under subsection (1)(c), where transcripts of the internet chat room conversations defendant had with minor provided compelling evidence that the meeting place was the Burger King, not a particular area within the Burger King.\u00a0 120 H. 480 (App.), 210 P.3d 3 (2009).\n\u00a0 Where it was not necessary for defendant to actually commit one of the felony offenses defined in \u00a7846E-1 in order to violate the prohibition against the electronic enticement of a child under subsection (1) but only necessary under subsection (1)(b)(iii) that defendant act with the intent to promote or facilitate the commission of a felony offense defined in \u00a7846E-1, the State was not required to specify in the indictment which \u00a7846E-1 felony offense defendant intended to promote or facilitate.\u00a0 120 H. 480 (App.), 210 P.3d 3 (2009).\n\u00a0 Where State presented evidence to the grand jury that the person communicating with defendant represented to defendant that the person was a 14-year old girl, the State was not required to prove under subsection (1)(a)(iii) that defendant engaged in communication with an actual child, and the record showed that the agreed upon meeting place was the Burger King and not a specific table within the Burger King, evidence before the grand jury that defendant arrived at the Burger King and was arrested was sufficient to establish probable cause regarding the meeting place element.\u00a0 120 H. 480 (App.), 210 P.3d 3 (2009).\n\u00a0 Circuit court did not abuse its discretion under HRE rule 403 in admitting video showing defendant masturbating for \"child\" where video: \u00a0(1) was extremely probative of defendant's intent to promote or facilitate the commission of one of the predicate felonies necessary to prove first degree electronic enticement of a child under this section; (2) provided clear evidence of defendant's motives and desires regarding the \"child\" and the extreme actions defendant was willing to undertake in order to entice the \"child\"; and (3) was the strongest evidence of defendant's intention to engage in sexual activity with the \"child\".\u00a0 128 H. 328 (App.), 289 P.3d 964 (2012).\n\u00a0 This section does not require proof that a defendant used a computer or other electronic device to travel to the agreed upon meeting place and the legislature did not intend the statute to require that the agreement to meet be accomplished through the use of a computer or other electronic device; requiring proof that the defendant used a computer to travel to the agreed upon meeting place at the agreed upon meeting time would lead to absurd results; thus, the circuit court did not erroneously instruct the jury on the elements for the charged offense of first degree electronic enticement of a child.\u00a0 128 H. 328 (App.), 289 P.3d 964 (2012)."
