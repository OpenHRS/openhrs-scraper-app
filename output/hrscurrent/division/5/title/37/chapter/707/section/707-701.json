analysis.\u00a0 The aggravated nature and severe sanctions traditionally associated with the crime of murder are hardly subjects of debate today.\u00a0 The actor in such a crime has disregarded the most highly held social values, and has proved oneself an extreme danger to society.\u00a0 The Code recognizes the highly aggravated nature of this crime in imposing its most severe sanction.\n\u00a0 Several states, and some recent efforts at penal law revision, recognize two degrees of murder.[1]\u00a0 One of the primary reasons for this distinction is to limit the scope of first degree murder in jurisdictions which make it a capital offense.[2]\u00a0 In states, like Hawaii, where the death penalty has been abolished, the above reason for the distinction is no longer applicable and the continuation of the distinction would be a carryover from the older death penalty legislation.\n\u00a0 Under previous Hawaii law, first degree murder required proof of \"deliberate premeditated malice aforethought.\"[3]\u00a0 For a conviction of murder in the second degree, the Hawaii law required only \"malice aforethought.\"[4]\u00a0 The Code is in accord with the Model Penal Code in making murder a unified offense which requires that the actor act intentionally or knowingly with respect to the homicidal result.[5]\u00a0 If a person has the conscious object of causing the death of another, or if the person is \"practically certain\" that the person will cause the death, the person has the requisite culpability for conviction.\n\u00a0 Murder has usually been defined to provide that it can be committed by extreme recklessness.\u00a0 In recent codes which do recognize two degrees of murder, a homicide caused with this lesser degree of mental culpability has been made murder in the second degree.[6]\u00a0 The net effect is to change manslaughter to murder when aggravated circumstances are present.\u00a0 Typically, these formulations hold an individual guilty of murder in the second degree if\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [h]e recklessly causes the death of another person under circumstances which manifest a cruel, wicked, and depraved indifference to human life.[7]\n\u00a0 Analytically, however, it is both simpler and more appropriate to leave provisions for more severe sentences in aggravated circumstances to those sections which are specifically designed to deal with such cases.\u00a0 An actor whose indifference to human life amounts to \"practical certainty\" of causing death will be held to have caused death knowingly under the Code's formulation of murder; but where the actor's conduct is characterized by a \"cruel, wicked, and depraved indifference,\" without more, these character traits ought to be taken into account at the time of disposition.\u00a0 Sections 706-661 and 706-662 provide for extended sentences in such aggravated circumstances.\u00a0 An individual who would, under a statute such as that quoted above, be convicted of second degree murder would, under the Code's system, be convicted of manslaughter and given an extended sentence.\u00a0 The resultant sentence may be the same in both cases;[8] however, where the other formulation requires the determination of the actor's character to be made by the finder of fact, the Code assigns this task to a psychiatrist, who is eminently better suited to make such determinations.\u00a0 More specifically, the psychiatrist must report that the actor's conduct is characterized by \"compulsive, aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to consequences, and that such condition makes him a serious danger to others.\"[9]\u00a0 It is easily seen that the psychiatrist is looking for precisely those traits which the trier of fact is asked to find in the other form of the statute.\u00a0 And, beyond the psychiatrist's greater expertise in making such determinations, the abnormality presented by such character traits falls more appropriately under special circumstances requiring prolonged treatment, via an extended sentence, than under greater moral culpability requiring conviction for a more serious offense.\n\u00a0 Felony-murder rule.\u00a0 The felony-murder rule[10] \"has an extensive history of thoughtful condemnation.\"[11]\u00a0 The genesis of the rule may have been due to an erroneous interpretation by Coke of a passage from Bracton and, at least since 1834, when His Majesty's Commissioners on Criminal Law found the rule to be \"totally incongruous with the general principles of our jurisprudence,\"[12] the rule has been condemned by writers and scholars.\n\u00a0 The felony-murder rule has been used to support murder convictions of defendants where one victim of a robbery accidentally shoots another victim,[13] where one of the defendant's co-robbers kills another co-robber during a robbery for the latter's refusal to obey orders and not as part of the robbery transaction,[14] and where the defendant (a dope addict) commits robbery of the defendant's homicide victim as an afterthought following the killing.[15]\u00a0 The application of the felony-murder rule dispenses with the need to prove that culpability with respect to the homicidal result that is otherwise required to support a conviction for murder and therefore leads to anomalous results.\u00a0 The rule has been called a \"legal Hydra.\"[16]\u00a0 \"Like the multiheaded beast of Greek mythology, the felony-murder rule has several 'heads' of its own, each willing to consume one of the accused's defenses by presuming a needed element in the proof of felony murder.\"[17]\n\u00a0 Because \"principled argument in its [the felony-murder rule's] defense is hard to find,\"[18] the Model Penal Code,[19] certain recent penal revisions,[20] and some recent cases[21] have limited the scope of the rule.\u00a0 The attempts to preserve the rule by limiting its application have taken a number of forms.\u00a0 Some recent revisions require that the death be recklessly caused in furtherance of a felony or attempted felony,[22] others require that the death be caused simply in furtherance of the felony and allow the defendant an affirmative defense if the defendant can show, in effect, that the defendant reasonably did not foresee the possibility of the killing.[23]\u00a0 That the killing may result from acts done negligently or recklessly (states of mind otherwise insufficient to establish murder) is not changed.\u00a0 California has limited the application of the rule by a re-interpretation of existing statutory language.[24]\u00a0 The court limited the rule in terms of persons:\u00a0 it held that a killing by a victim of the attempted felony of defendant's co-felon was not \"to perpetrate\" the felony and that the felony-murder rule was not applicable to the surviving defendant.\u00a0 In view of the statutory language making the rule applicable to killings in the perpetration of an enumerated felony, the language and logic of the court are somewhat strained.[25]\u00a0 However, the court's attempt to limit the rule and thereby avoid the questionable results brought about by the rule's broad application has been characterized as a \"heightened awareness of the doctrine's underlying illogic.\"[26]\u00a0 The Model Penal Code has taken a different approach: it has abandoned the felony-murder rule as a rule of substantive law and has reformulated it as a rule of evidence.\u00a0 Extreme recklessness, which under the M.P.C. is sufficient to establish murder, may be presumed from the commission of certain enumerated felonies.[27]\n\u00a0 The wiser course, it seems, would be to follow the lead of England[28] and India[29] and abolish the felony-murder rule in its entirety.\u00a0 The rule certainly is not an indispensable ingredient in a system of criminal injustice; \"[t]he rule is unknown as such in continental Europe.\"[30]\n\u00a0 Even in its limited formulation the felony-murder rule is still objectionable.\u00a0 It is not sound principle to convert an accidental, negligent, or reckless homicide into a murder simply because, without more, the killing was in furtherance of a criminal objective of some defined class.\u00a0 Engaging in certain penally-prohibited behavior may, of course, evidence a recklessness sufficient to establish manslaughter, or a practical certainty or intent, with respect to causing death, sufficient to establish murder, but such a finding is an independent determination which must rest on the facts of each case.\u00a0 Limited empirical data discloses that the ratio of homicides in the course of specific felonies[31] to the total number of those felonies does not justify a presumption of culpability with respect to the homicide result sufficient to establish murder.[32]\u00a0 There appears to be no logical base for the felony-murder rule which presumes, either conclusively or subject to rebuttal, culpability sufficient to establish murder.[33]\n\u00a0 Nor does the felony-murder rule serve a legitimate deterrent function.\u00a0 The actor has already disregarded the presumably sufficient penalties imposed for the underlying felony.\u00a0 If the murder penalty is to be used to reinforce the deterrent effect of penalties imposed for certain felonies (by converting an accidental, negligent, or reckless killing into a murder), it would be more effective, and hardly more fortuitous, to select a certain ratio of convicted felons for the murder penalty by lot.[34]\n\u00a0 In recognition of the trend toward, and the substantial body of criticism supporting, the abolition of the felony-murder rule, and because of the extremely questionable results which the rule has worked in other jurisdictions, the Code has eliminated from our law the felony-murder rule.\n\u00a0 General effect of Code.\u00a0 The homicide sections of the Code substantially simplify and clarify the law of Hawaii, although the results reached by the court or jury in most cases will probably be similar.\u00a0 As explained above, the felony-murder rule has been eliminated.\n\u00a0 Previous Hawaii law provided that a person convicted of murder in the first degree shall be imprisoned at hard labor for life not subject to parole.[35]\u00a0 A person convicted of murder in the second degree, under previous law, would be sentenced to \"imprisonment at hard labor for any number of years but for a term not less than twenty years.\"[36]\u00a0 Under the Code, a convicted defendant will be sentenced to imprisonment for an indeterminate term, the maximum length of which will be life imprisonment without parole in four instances set forth in \u00a7706-606(a) or life or twenty years as determined by the court.[37]\u00a0 The possibility of eventual parole is made available by the general revision of sentencing in chapter 706.\n\u00a0 The need for clarification of the law has been implied rather strongly by the Supreme Court of Hawaii.\u00a0 For instance, the court has stated plainly, on a number of occasions, that it is reversible error, in some murder trials, to instruct the jury in the language of the previous statutory presumption on \"malice aforethought.\"[38]\u00a0 Moreover, although the court said that \"malice aforethought\" was the same as \"malice,\"[39] it was not the same \"malice\" as that which was defined in the prior penal code,[40] and it was apparently reversible error in any homicide prosecution to instruct the jury in the language of the statutory definition.[41]\u00a0 Furthermore, the antiquity and ambiguity of, and the difficulty in dealing with, the requirement of \"malice aforethought\" is evident from a cursory glance at court opinions.[42]\u00a0 This Code eliminates such problems of interpretation, while achieving greater simplicity and consistency.\n\u00a0\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON \u00a7707-701\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 The legislature, in adopting the Code in 1972, added the provision for mandatory life imprisonment without parole (but subject to commutation) as contained in \u00a7706-606(a).\u00a0 The legislature stated that these instances \"are so threatening to the security of our society that the severest deterrent penalty should be required.\"\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 2 (1972).\u00a0 The reader is referred to the discussion in the Supplemental Commentary on \u00a7706-606.\n\u00a0 Act 230, Session Laws 2006, amended subsection (1) to clarify that the killing of a person known by the defendant to be a witness in a criminal prosecution is murder in the first degree [if the killing is related to the person's status as a witness].\u00a0 House Standing Committee Report No. 665-06.\n\u00a0 Act 63, Session Laws 2011, amended this section by establishing first degree murder for a person who causes death to a person:\u00a0 (1) from whom the defendant has been restrained, by order of any court, from contacting, threatening, or physically abusing pursuant to domestic abuse protective orders; (2) who is being protected by a police officer ordering the defendant to leave the premises of the protected person, during the effective period of the order; or (3) who is known by the defendant to be a witness in a family court proceeding and the killing is related to the person's status as a witness.\u00a0 The legislature found that domestic violence victims need added protection under Hawaii law.\u00a0 Restraining orders or orders from police officers to abusers to leave the premises are intended to remove abusers from the vicinity of domestic violence victims and provide safety.\u00a0 The legislature believed that domestic violence victims are particularly vulnerable when they attempt to disengage from their abusers and at that time, violence and the threat of violence are at the most extreme levels.\u00a0 Increasing the penalties against abusers in those situations may deter violent retaliation and may help break victims from the cycle of violence.\u00a0 House Standing Committee Report No. 930, Conference Committee Report No. 74, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1255.\n\u00a0 Act 214, Session Laws 2016, amended this section to broaden the offense of murder in the first degree to include cases in which the victim was restrained as a shield, hostage, or for ransom or reward.\u00a0 The legislature found that the offense of murder in the first degree was a narrowly defined offense that was limited to cases in which there were multiple victims, the victim was killed by a hired killer, or the victim was under the specific protection of or had a particular role with the courts or law enforcement system.\u00a0 Defendants convicted of murder in the first degree are automatically sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.\u00a0 All other forms of murder are covered under the offense of murder in the second degree, and defendants convicted of murder in the second degree are generally sentenced to life imprisonment with the possibility of parole.\u00a0 However, it is possible for a defendant convicted of murder in the second degree to be sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole if enhanced sentencing under \u00a7706-657 or an extended term of imprisonment under \u00a7706-661 is applied.\u00a0 The legislature found that the different sentencing requirements between these two offenses can have a tremendous impact on the surviving members of the victims' families.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3451, Conference Committee Report No. 65-16.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 See also notes to \u00a7706-606.\n\u00a0 Attempted murder is treated as ordinary class A felony and is subject to imprisonment for 20 years.\u00a0 57 H. 418, 558 P.2d 1012 (1976).\n\u00a0 In murder prosecutions where instructions on self-defense are given, the court shall instruct on manslaughter, subject to one exception.\u00a0 58 H. 492, 573 P.2d 959 (1977).\n\u00a0 Indictment for murder properly included allegation that defendant knew the victim was a witness in a prior murder prosecution.\u00a0 59 H. 625, 586 P.2d 250 (1978).\n\u00a0 In prosecution for murder, evidence of mental disease did not raise the question whether offense was murder or manslaughter.\u00a0 61 H. 193, 600 P.2d 1139 (1979).\n\u00a0 Reckless endangering in the second degree is a lesser included offense of attempted murder.\u00a0 62 H. 637, 618 P.2d 306 (1980).\n\u00a0 Sufficiency of evidence on motion for acquittal.\u00a0 63 H. 51, 621 P.2d 343 (1980).\n\u00a0 Trial court erred by not including jury instructions on mitigating defense.\u00a0 70 H. 509, 778 P.2d 704 (1989).\n\u00a0 Where petitioner's convictions on counts I (attempted first degree murder), II (second degree murder), and III (attempted second degree murder) violated \u00a7701-109(1)(c)'s clear prohibition against inconsistent factual findings, the failure to raise this issue, both at trial and on appeal, resulted in withdrawal of not only a potentially meritorious defense, but a defense that would have altered the outcome.\u00a0 74 H. 442, 848 P.2d 966 (1993).\n\u00a0 State of mind required to establish attendant circumstance of \"arising out of the performance of official duties\" is \"intentionally or knowingly\"; although instruction merely tracked statutory language of subsection (1)(b) by requiring proof beyond reasonable doubt that police officer's death arose out of performance of officer's official duties, the deficiency in instruction did not affect defendant's substantial rights.\u00a0 75 H. 282, 859 P.2d 1369 (1993).\n\u00a0 Court's instruction that, in order to convict defendant of attempted first degree murder, the jury must find \"conduct intended or known to cause the death of [two individuals] in the same incident\" did not omit a material element of the offense and was not otherwise defective.\u00a0 86 H. 1, 946 P.2d 955 (1997).\n\u00a0 Section 707-702(2) precludes multiple manslaughter convictions based on a single count charging first degree murder under subsection (1)(a).\u00a0 99 H. 542, 57 P.3d 467 (2002).\n\u00a0 Where negativing of defendant's mitigating extreme mental or emotional distress defense by prosecution was a material element of the offense of first degree murder such that jury unanimity was a prerequisite to returning any verdict, and trial court's special instruction expressly directed the jury to convict defendant of manslaughter if a single juror believed that the prosecution had failed to negative the mitigating defense, constitutional right to unanimous jury verdict violated.\u00a0 99 H. 542, 57 P.3d 467 (2002).\n\u00a0 With the January 1, 1987 repeal of the language in this section (pre-1986 amendment), murder is no longer classified as a class A felony.\u00a0 102 H. 282, 75 P.3d 1173 (2003).\n\u00a0 One cannot be convicted of both attempted murder and of violation of \u00a7291C-12, failure to render assistance.\u00a0 1 H. App. 625, 623 P.2d 1271 (1981).\n\u00a0 Murder is not lesser included offense of murder for hire.\u00a0 3 H. App. 107, 643 P.2d 807 (1982).\n\u00a0 Crime of attempted manslaughter is an included offense of attempted murder.\u00a0 7 H. App. 291, 757 P.2d 1175 (1987).\n\u00a0 Mentioned:\u00a0 74 H. 141, 838 P.2d 1374 (1992).\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7707-701 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 E.g., H.R.S. \u00a7748-1; Prop. Del. Cr.
