Rev. 307 (2000).\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Assault in the third degree is not a lesser included offense.\u00a0 68 H. 276, 711 P.2d 1289 (1985).\n\u00a0 Circuit court was obligated, even absent a request by either party, to instruct the jury regarding the included offense of assault in the third degree where appellant was charged with committing offense of assault in the second degree; court's failure to do so constituted plain error.\u00a0 76 H. 387, 879 P.2d 492 (1994).\n\u00a0 Conviction of defendant of offense of carrying, using or threatening to use a firearm in the commission of a separate felony under \u00a7134-6(a) and (e), the separate felony being second degree assault under subsection (1)(a), vacated where there was no substantial evidence that defendant caused substantial bodily injury to victim as required under subsection (1)(a).\u00a0 94 H. 241, 11 P.3d 466 (2000).\n\u00a0 The plain and unambiguous language of \u00a7853-4(2) does not prohibit the grant of a deferred acceptance of no contest plea for assault in the second degree under this section causing \"substantial bodily injury\", as statutory prohibition expressly applies only to felony and misdemeanor assaults inflicting \"bodily injury\" or \"serious bodily injury\".\u00a0 101 H. 409, 70 P.3d 635 (2003).\n\u00a0 Court's failure to personally engage defendant in on-the-record colloquy to determine whether defendant understood consequences of foregoing right to have jury instructed on third degree assault, the lesser-included offense of second degree assault, constituted plain error.\u00a0 85 H. 44 (App.), 936 P.2d 1292 (1997).\n\u00a0 Trial court's omission of the \"strongly corroborative\" paragraph in the attempted assault in the second degree instructions was presumptively prejudicial and omission was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u00a0 104 H. 517 (App.), 92 P.3d 1027 (2004).\n\u00a0 Although the evidence was insufficient to show that defendant committed the offense of first degree assault, there was ample evidence to show that the victim's injury satisfied the definition of \"substantial bodily injury\" under \u00a7707-700 and that defendant thus committed the lesser included offense of second degree assault in violation of subsection (1)(a); thus the jury, having returned a guilty verdict against defendant for first degree assault, must also have found sufficient evidence to prove the lesser included offense of second degree assault.\u00a0 116 H. 445 (App.), 173 P.3d 592 (2007).\n\u00a0 Cited:\u00a0 55 H. 531, 534, 523 P.2d 299 (1974)."
