[L 1988, c 292, pt of \u00a71; am L 2012, c 316, \u00a72]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7707-702.5\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Act 292, Session Laws 1988, added this section to redefine negligent homicide in the first degree.\u00a0 The legislature felt that stronger measures were needed to protect the public and to deter those who negligently operate a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, which results in bodily injury or death to others.\u00a0 Senate Conference Committee Report No. 278, House Conference Committee Report No. 105-88.\n\u00a0 Act 316, Session Laws 2012, amended this section to include a provision for incidents involving a vulnerable highway user.\u00a0 Hawaii's roadways have often been called dangerous for pedestrians, cyclists, and others who legally use the public right of way without being in a motor vehicle.\u00a0 Unfortunately, when collisions occur between motor vehicles and these individuals, the outcome is often catastrophic. \u00a0Amending the offense of negligent homicide in the first degree to include a provision for incidents in which vulnerable highway users are involved may, at the very least, increase driver awareness of these individuals.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 33-12."
