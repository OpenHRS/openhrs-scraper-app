[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; am L 1981, c 171, \u00a72; gen ch 1993; am L 2015, c 35, \u00a724]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 A specific unanimity jury instruction was not required for offense of second degree unlawful imprisonment under this section where defendant's conduct, as proved by the prosecution, constituted a continuing course of conduct \"set on foot by a single impulse and operated by an unintermittent force\", with \"one general intent ... and one continuous plan\".\u00a0 95 H. 440, 24 P.3d 32 (2001).\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7\u00a7707-720 TO 707-722\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 These three offenses are gradations based upon the underlying conduct of interference with a person's liberty.\u00a0 The gradations are based upon the seriousness of the circumstances or purpose attending this interference.\u00a0 The interference with liberty is dealt with under the general definition of \"restrain.\"[1]\n\u00a0 Where the restraint is for the purpose of personal gain, or for certain purposes which are themselves unlawful, the offense is termed \"kidnapping,\" and the most severe sanctions apply.[2]\u00a0 The statutory provision for mitigation, in cases where the victim is released unharmed, is intended (1) to differentiate according to the severity of the actual harm involved, and (2) to encourage the actor to proceed less dangerously once the criminal course of conduct has begun.[3]\n\u00a0 Previous Hawaii law defined kidnapping as the forceful, fraudulent, or deceitful imprisonment, seizing, detention, or inveiglement of any person.[4]\u00a0 The difficulty in dealing with such words is immediately apparent.\u00a0 Moreover, the mandatory term of life imprisonment is thought somewhat too harsh to be imposed as a rule.\u00a0 Instances of kidnapping which are so heinous as to call for a sanction commensurate with that for murder will almost necessarily fall under the provisions for extended sentences, whereby the normal sentence for a class A felony may be extended to life imprisonment.[5]\u00a0 The Code's sentence is commensurate with that of the Model Penal Code and with most recent state revisions.[6]\n\u00a0 Where the restraint poses a danger of serious injury, or where it involves involuntary servitude, the offense, defined in \u00a7707-721, is \"unlawful imprisonment in the first degree.\"\u00a0 This offense is a class C felony, commensurate with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a71581 et seq., which, enacted pursuant to the Thirteenth Amendment, makes it a felony to hold or return a person \"to a condition of peonage,\" or to kidnap, carry away, or hold a person to be \"sold into involuntary servitude, or held as a slave.\"\n\u00a0 Unlawful imprisonment in the second degree consists of any knowing restraint of another person.\u00a0 The offense is graded as a misdemeanor, and is commensurate with the common-law offense of false imprisonment: it is also the substantial equivalent of \"unlawful imprisonment\" under previous Hawaii law.[7]\u00a0 The lawful exercise of custodial powers over a minor is, of course, excluded from the operation of this section.\n\u00a0 It must be noted that, in all the above offenses involving interference with personal liberty, the duration of restraint necessary for conviction depends upon the intent and attendant circumstances.\u00a0 In this regard, something like a reasonable standard applies.\u00a0 Hence, a short restraint in an area where the victim might suffocate or come to other bodily harm would constitute a substantial interference with liberty under these sections.\u00a0 However, a short restraint in a store, based on a reasonable suspicion of shoplifting, would not amount to a substantial interference with liberty for the purposes of these offenses.[8]\n\u00a0\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON \u00a7\u00a7707-720 TO 707-722\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 When the legislature adopted the Code in 1972, it added the affirmative defense now set forth in \u00a7707-722(3).\u00a0 It is an attempt to assure that reasonable restraint is allowed for the purpose of apprehending persons suspected of \"shoplifting.\"\n\u00a0 The Conference Committee Report of the legislature stated:\n\u00a0 It is the intent of your Committee that \"reasonable grounds\" includes, but is not limited to, knowledge that a person has concealed possession of unpurchased merchandise of the retail mercantile establishment; that \"reasonable time\" means the time necessary to permit the person detained to make a statement or to refuse to make a statement, and the time necessary to examine employees, and records of the mercantile establishment relative to the ownership of the merchandise; and that \"retail mercantile establishment\" means a place where goods, wares, or merchandise are offered to the public for sale.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 2 (1972).\n\u00a0 Act 147, Session Laws 2008, amended \u00a7707-720(1) by making it a crime of kidnapping to intentionally or knowingly restrain another person with the intent to unlawfully obtain the labor or services of the person, regardless of whether a debt collection is involved.\u00a0 The legislature strengthened the laws on prostitution and related offenses to deter and punish sexual exploitation of minors, including obscenity-related activities.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 38-08.\n\u00a0 Act 147, Session Laws 2008, amended \u00a7707-721(1) by deleting a reference to involuntary servitude.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 38-08.\n\u00a0 Act 35, Session Laws 2015, amended \u00a7707-722(2) and (3) by making technical nonsubstantive amendments.\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7\u00a7707-720 to 707-722 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 \u00a7707-700(5).\n\u00a0\n2.\u00a0 \u00a7707-720.\n\u00a0\n3.\u00a0 \u00a7707-720(3).\n\u00a0\n4.\u00a0 H.R.S. \u00a7749-1.\n\u00a0\n5.\u00a0 Cf. \u00a7\u00a7706-661, 662.\n\u00a0\n6.\u00a0 M.P.C. \u00a7212.1;
