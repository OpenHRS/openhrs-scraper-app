[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; am L 1990, c 62, \u00a71; gen ch 1992; am L 2006, c 230, \u00a730]\n\u00a0\nCross References\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Definition of recklessly, see \u00a7702-206.\n\u00a0 Definition of \"widely dangerous means\", see \u00a7708-800.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Statute essentially the equivalent of federal statute on \"assault with dangerous weapon with intent to do bodily harm\" set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7113(c).\u00a0 376 F. Supp. 1024 (1974).\n\u00a0 This offense is a lesser included offense of attempted murder under \u00a7701-109(4).\u00a0 62 H. 637, 618 P.2d 306 (1980).\n\u00a0 Based on testimony of a vendor and dirt biker, there was substantial evidence upon which a jury could have found that defendant discharged a firearm in a populated area, supporting defendant's conviction under this section.\u00a0 106 H. 62 (App.), 101 P.3d 671 (2004).\n\u00a0 Cited:\u00a0 55 H. 531, 534, 523 P.2d 299 (1974).\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7\u00a7707-713 AND 707-714\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 The Code follows the lead of the Model Penal Code in providing two general sections for conduct which recklessly endangers human life.[1]\u00a0 Previous Hawaii law covered, as does the law of most jurisdictions,[2] such cases of reckless endangering on an ad hoc basis.[3]\u00a0 A quick perusal of such statutes reveals that they all have in common the reckless endangering of human life.\u00a0 The Code obviates the need for special legislation on each dangerous instrument or act.\u00a0 Rather, all conduct so endangering human life or limb is made a misdemeanor.\n\u00a0 The aggravated offense of reckless endangering in the first degree, \u00a7707-713, is reserved for cases where the actor employs \"widely dangerous means.\"\u00a0 Widely dangerous means, as defined in \u00a7708-800, are those means which are known to be capable of causing widespread damage or destruction to both life and property.\u00a0 It is thought that where the potential for destruction is this great, the actor's dangerousness to society is increased so substantially, over the case where only a single or a few people are threatened, that the felony sanction is justified.\n\u00a0\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON \u00a7\u00a7707-713 AND 707-714\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Act 215, Session Laws 1978, added to \u00a7707-713(1) the words \"or intentionally fires a firearm in a manner which places another person in danger of death or serious bodily injury.\"\u00a0 The legislature felt that the grave dangers posed by the use of a firearm justified a felony sanction.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 675-78, House Standing Committee Report No. 116.\n\u00a0 Act 285, Session Laws 1988, amended \u00a7707-713 for the purpose of limiting the offense, in regard to firearms, to a person who intentionally fires a firearm in a manner which recklessly places another person in danger of death or serious bodily injury.\u00a0 House Standing Committee Report No. 1604-88, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2141.\n\u00a0 Act 62, Session Laws 1990, amended \u00a7707-714 to subject to misdemeanor liability, a person who creates an obvious risk to the public by intentionally discharging a firearm in areas likely to be traveled or inhabited.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3060.\n\u00a0 Act 230, Session Laws 2006, amended \u00a7707-714 by making technical nonsubstantive amendments.\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7\u00a7707-713 And 707-714 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 M.P.C. \u00a7220.2(2) and 211.2.\n\u00a0\n2.\u00a0 Cf.
