\u00a7\u00a7707-710 TO 707-712\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 These sections of the Code consolidate offenses previously classified as \"assault\", \"battery\", and \"affray\".[1]\u00a0 Nonfatal bodily offenses against the person are termed assaults, and are graded according to the gravity of the harm or danger they represent.[2]\n\u00a0 Assault in the first degree, as defined in \u00a7707-710, is the most serious, combining the requirements of the most culpable states of mind with the most serious bodily injury, short of homicide.\u00a0 Accordingly, assault in the first degree is made a class B felony, one class below murder.\n\u00a0 Assault in the second degree, as defined in \u00a7707-711, embodies two types of behavior-and-result.\u00a0 (1) When a person acts intentionally or knowingly, with a dangerous instrument, the definition of the offense does not require the bodily injury inflicted to be serious, as in the first degree.\u00a0 However, the offense is still a felony, albeit one class lower.\u00a0 Assault offenses are intended to penalize injurious conduct to the bodily integrity of the person.\u00a0 The danger represented by the use of a dangerous instrument is largely inchoate in nature, and, although constituting an aggravating circumstance, the danger is not of the same order as the actual infliction of serious bodily injury.\u00a0 Hence, the offense is a class C felony.\u00a0 (2) When a person acts recklessly the person's state of mind is far less culpable than the intentional or knowing actor; however, the employment of a dangerous instrument and the infliction of serious harm present dangers which, in total, require treatment as a class C felony.\n\u00a0 Assault in the third degree, as defined in \u00a7707-712, is treated as a misdemeanor.\u00a0 In subsection (1)(a), where a person acts intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly, the less serious nature of the injury, together with the absence of aggravating circumstances, warrant the less severe penalty.\u00a0 In subsection (1)(b), negligent culpability will suffice where the aggravating circumstance of a dangerous instrument is present.\u00a0 Assault in the third degree is reduced to a petty misdemeanor if the harm is inflicted in a fight or scuffle entered into by mutual consent.\n\u00a0 The Code's gradation of assaults follows generally the Model Penal Code.[3]\u00a0 Previous Hawaii law defined assault in terms of attempt to injure another.[4]\u00a0 Also included was the placing of another in apprehension of being injured.[5]\u00a0 The Code handles this latter case in the sections on Reckless Endangering (\u00a7\u00a7707-713 and 714) and Terroristic Threatening (\u00a7707-715).\u00a0 After the definition of the basic offense of assault, the Hawaii Revised Statutes listed three classes of aggravating circumstances, calling for either felony or misdemeanor sanctions, depending upon the severity of the aggravation.[6]\u00a0 The unaggravated offense was slightly more severe than, but roughly equivalent to, a petty misdemeanor.[7]\u00a0 Consensual scuffles were included in the unaggravated offense.[8]\u00a0 Hence the Code is similar in both structure and penalty to prior Hawaii law, but achieves greater economy and clarity of statement.\n\u00a0\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON \u00a7\u00a7707-710 TO 707-712\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Act 84, Session Laws 1979, added subsection (c) to \u00a7707-711 as a means of deterring a rising number of assaults committed against correctional officers.\u00a0 The legislature found that due to the very nature of a corrections facility, a high probability existed that correctional workers who were not on duty might be assaulted within the facility.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 14.\n\u00a0 Act 257, Session Laws 1987, amended \u00a7707-711 to give educational workers added protection by making it a crime to assault them.\u00a0 Senate Conference Committee Report No. 24, House Conference Committee Report No. 20.\n\u00a0 Act 279, Session Laws 1988, amended \u00a7707-711 to clarify that second degree assault does not include persons injuring themselves.\u00a0 House Standing Committee Report No. 1598-88.\n\u00a0 Act 230, Session Laws 2006, amended \u00a7707-711(1) by adding, as an element of the offense of assault in the second degree, the reckless causing of substantial bodily injury to another person.\n\u00a0 Act 298, Session Laws 2006, amended \u00a7707-711 by including an employee of a charter school in the definition of \"educational worker.\"\n\u00a0 Act 9, Session Laws 2007, amended \u00a7707-711(1)(e) by deleting the brackets around the word \"or\" to ratify the revisor's insertion of \"or,\" which was done to blend the amendments by Acts 230 and 298, Session Laws 2006, to the definition of \"educational worker.\"\u00a0 House Standing Committee Report No. 807.\n\u00a0 Act 79, Session Laws 2007, amended \u00a7707-711(1) by establishing a criminal offense of assault in the second degree if a person intentionally [or] knowingly causes bodily injury to any emergency medical services personnel who is engaged in the performance of duty.\u00a0 The legislature found that emergency medical services personnel are at a heightened risk of personal injury or death from patients and others with whom they are in contact in the course of their work.\u00a0 By the very nature of the job, emergency medical services personnel respond to people in distressful situations, which include incidences of criminal violence, family disputes, and drunken brawls.\u00a0 Although the legislature acknowledged that much of the violence promulgated from explosive situations involving agitated people who lack momentary self-control, the legislature believed that emergency medical [services] personnel should be afforded the same protection as correctional workers and educational workers.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1244.\n\u00a0 Act 100, Session Laws 2008, amended \u00a7707-711(1) by making an assault on a person employed at a state-operated or -contracted mental health facility assault in the second degree, a class C felony.\u00a0 The legislature found that mental health professionals need to be protected from criminal behavior that, at times, occurs during the course of performing their job duties.\u00a0 Act 100 imposed the same penalty on a defendant that knowingly [or intentionally] assaults a staff member at the Hawaii state hospital as that imposed for assaults that occur in a school or correctional facility.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2331, Conference Committee Report No. 37-08.\n\u00a0 Act 146, Session Laws 2010, amended \u00a7707-711(1) by expanding the class of emergency services providers protected against assault to include, among others, physicians, physician's assistants, nurses, and nurse practitioners providing medical services in a hospital emergency room.\u00a0 The legislature found that emergency medical workers serve an indispensable public need but face a high level of risk in the line of duty.\u00a0 Nationally, studies show that between thirty-five per cent and eighty per cent of hospital staff have been physically assaulted at least once and that nurses are at an increased risk for violence while on duty.\u00a0 The legislature found that extending the offense of assault in the second degree to include actions against emergency services providers in emergency rooms is a logical extension of the existing provisions covering emergency response personnel.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report Nos. 2989 and 2765, House Standing Committee Report No. 466-10, Conference Committee Report No. 33-10.\n\u00a0 Act 63, Session Laws 2011, amended \u00a7707-711(1) by establishing second degree assault for a person who causes bodily injury to a person: (1) from whom the defendant has been restrained, by order of any court, from contacting, threatening, or physically abusing pursuant to domestic abuse protective orders; or (2) who is being protected by a police officer ordering the defendant to leave the premises of the protected person, during the effective period of the order.\u00a0 The legislature found that domestic violence victims need added protection under Hawaii law.\u00a0 Restraining orders or orders from police officers to abusers to leave the premises are intended to remove abusers from the vicinity of domestic violence victims and provide safety.\u00a0 The legislature believed that domestic violence victims are particularly vulnerable when they attempt to disengage from their abusers and at that time, violence and the threat of violence are at the most extreme levels.\u00a0 Increasing the penalties against abusers in those situations may deter violent retaliation and may help break victims from the cycle of violence.\u00a0 House Standing Committee Report No. 930, Conference Committee Report No. 74, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1255.\n\u00a0 Act 187, Session Laws 2011, amended \u00a7707-711(1) by adding to the offense of assault in the second degree intentionally or knowingly causing bodily injury to a firefighter or water safety officer who is engaged in the performance of duty.\u00a0 Firefighters and water safety officers, like correctional workers, educational workers, and emergency medical services providers, may find themselves in hostile and volatile situations, stemming from drug use by or domestic violence between members of the public.\u00a0 The volatile situations can erupt and place a firefighter or water safety officer in danger trying to perform public safety functions.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 32.\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7\u00a7707-710 To 707-712
