Establishing extreme mental or emotional disturbance as an affirmative defense requires the defense to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant suffers from extreme mental or emotional disturbance. Conference Committee Report No. 56.\n\u00a0 Act 230, Session Laws 2006, amended subsection (1) by making technical nonsubstantive amendments.\n\u00a0\nLaw Journals and Reviews\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Extreme Emotion.\u00a0 12 UH L.

if record does not reflect any such evidence, then trial court shall refuse to instruct the jury on extreme mental or emotional disturbance manslaughter; if record does reflect any evidence, then issue must be submitted to jury and court should instruct jury on extreme mental or emotional disturbance manslaughter.\u00a0 88 H. 325, 966 P.2d 637 (1998).\n\u00a0 As conviction for manslaughter due to an extreme mental or emotional disturbance under subsection (2) is deemed an acquittal of murder, double jeopardy barred defendant's reprosecution for second degree murder under \u00a7707-701.5.\u00a0 88 H. 356, 966 P.2d 1082 (1998).\n\u00a0 Prosecution not barred from reprosecuting defendant for offense of reckless manslaughter under subsection (1)(a) as reckless manslaughter is a lesser included offense of murder and remanding a case for retrial on lesser included offenses not barred by double jeopardy.\u00a0 88 H. 356, 966 P.2d 1082 (1998).\n\u00a0 Trial court did not err in giving jury instruction that the presence or absence of self-control was a significant factor in determining whether a defendant was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance in such a manner as to reduce attempted murder to attempted extreme mental or emotional disturbance manslaughter. 90 H. 65, 976 P.2d 379 (1999).\n\u00a0 When considered in conjunction with the testimony of expert witnesses, where there was substantial evidence adduced at trial that defendant was not experiencing a loss of control during defendant's attack on victim and was not acting under extreme mental or emotional distress, trial court did not err in refusing to convict defendant of the included offense of manslaughter.\u00a0\u00a0 93 H. 224, 999 P.2d 230 (2000).\n\u00a0 Trial court did not err in declining to provide extreme mental or emotional disturbance defense instruction to jury where generalized testimony that baby victim could cry a lot and that defendant sometimes lost defendant's temper in stressful situations, without more, was not probative that during the incident in question, defendant acted, even from a subjective standpoint, under a loss of self-control resulting from extreme mental or emotional disturbance.\u00a0 97 H. 299, 36 P.3d 1269 (2001).\n\u00a0 Subsection (2) precludes multiple manslaughter convictions based on a single count charging first degree murder under \u00a7707-701(1)(a).\u00a0 99 H. 542, 57 P.3d 467 (2002).\n\u00a0 Where negativing of defendant's mitigating extreme mental or emotional distress defense by prosecution was a material element of the offense of first degree murder such that jury unanimity was a prerequisite to returning any verdict, and trial court's special instruction expressly directed the jury to convict defendant of manslaughter if a single juror believed that the prosecution had failed to negative the mitigating defense, constitutional right to unanimous jury verdict violated.\u00a0 99 H. 542, 57 P.3d 467 (2002).\n\u00a0 Where evidence that child was a victim of battered child syndrome was relevant to show that child's death was not an accident, but the result of an intentional, knowing or reckless criminal act, giving rise to a duty on defendant's part to obtain medical care for child pursuant to \u00a7663-1.6, trial court did not err in admitting expert testimony that child was a victim of battered child syndrome.\u00a0 101 H. 332, 68 P.3d 606 (2003).\n\u00a0 A mother's prosecution for her own prenatal conduct, which causes the death of the baby subsequently born alive, is not within the plain meaning of subsection (1)(a), in conjunction with the general provisions of penal liability found in the Hawaii Penal Code.\u00a0 109 H. 115, 123 P.3d 1210 (2005).\n\u00a0 Evidence presented to grand jury was sufficient to support indictment for manslaughter.\u00a0 1 H. App. 396, 620 P.2d 740 (1980).\n\u00a0 Evidence that defendant supplied a knife to another knowing that the other was about to engage in a fight with decedent who was killed with the knife held sufficient.\u00a0 2 H. App. 277, 630 P.2d 650 (1981).\n\u00a0 \"Extreme mental or emotional disturbance\" and \"reasonable explanation\" construed; evidence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance.\u00a0 6 H. App. 173, 715 P.2d 822 (1986).\n\u00a0 Defendant not entitled to burden-of-proof instruction regarding manslaughter, where no evidence supported manslaughter defense.\u00a0 6 H. App. 409, 723 P.2d 186 (1986).\n\u00a0 Crime of attempted manslaughter is an included offense of attempted murder; includes both voluntary and involuntary manslaughter.\u00a0 7 H. App. 291, 757 P.2d 1175 (1987).\n\u00a0 Trial court did not err in refusing to give jury instruction on manslaughter due to extreme mental or emotional disturbance (EMED) where evidence must show that that defendant was under the influence of an EMED at the time defendant committed the crime; EMED defense was not supported by evidence that when defendant returned to accomplice's apartment after allegedly committing the murder, defendant was not oneself and in \"kind of a panic\".\u00a0 119 H. 74 (App.), 193 P.3d 1274 (2008).\n\u00a0 Where the evidence sufficiently raised the issue of extreme mental or emotional disturbance, the circuit court was required to instruct the jury on the defense of extreme mental or emotional disturbance notwithstanding that a \"waiver\" of the instruction was elicited from the defendant.\u00a0 132 H. 123, 319 P.3d 1131 (2014).\n\u00a0 Cited:\u00a0 132 H. 451, 323 P.3d 95 (2014).\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7707-702 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 M.P.C. \u00a7210.3; N.Y.R.P.L. \u00a7125.15; Prop.
