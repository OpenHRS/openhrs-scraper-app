App. 659, 706 P.2d 1333 (1985).\n\u00a0 Based on \u00a7701-109(4)(a), fourth degree sexual assault under \u00a7707-733(1)(a) is a lesser included offense of third degree sexual assault under subsection (1)(e).\u00a0 85 H. 92 (App.), 937 P.2d 933 (1997).\n\u00a0 Third degree sexual assault committed in violation of subsection (1)(e) not a continuous offense; defendant's convictions of five counts of that offense, each based on a separate sexual contact thus did not violate \u00a7701-109(1)(e).\u00a0 85 H. 92 (App.), 937 P.2d 933 (1997).\n\u00a0 Placement of the elemental attendant circumstances after the state of mind in the enumerated elements instruction was not error; when read and considered as a whole, the instructions adequately informed the jury of the prosecution's burden to prove that complainant did not consent to the acts alleged and was not married to defendant at the time, and that defendant was aware of both circumstances when defendant acted.\u00a0 97 H. 140 (App.), 34 P.3d 1039 (2000).\n\u00a0 Although criminal sanctions are clearly directed only at adult conduct under subsection (1)(b) and \u00a7707-730(1)(b), there is no legislative history that supports a conclusion that only adults were intended to be prohibited from the proscribed sexual conduct; when the legislature amended subsection (1) and \u00a7707-730(1) in 2001, and could have, but did not include language allowing consensual sexual conduct between, for example, two thirteen year olds, the legislative intent was to maintain the existing prohibitions against such conduct.\u00a0 121 H. 92 (App.), 214 P.3d 1082 (2009).\n\u00a0 Section 707-730(1)(b) and subsection (1)(b), as applied to private consensual acts between two persons, including minors, did not violate minor's right to privacy as the State has at least a significant interest in regulating the sexual activities of children under the age of fourteen; in addition, there is no fundamental personal privacy right for minors under the age of fourteen to engage in sexual activities with other children under the age of fourteen; this applies to young boys, as well as to young girls, and is not strictly dependent on an age differential between the children.\u00a0 121 H. 92 (App.), 214 P.3d 1082 (2009).\n\u00a0 State's exercise of prosecutorial discretion in the case was not constitutionally infirm where defendant failed to meet the burden of demonstrating that defendant was prosecuted based on an arbitrary classification; defendant was prosecuted under \u00a7707-730 and this section based on allegations that defendant was significantly older than child #1, had initiated the prohibited sexual activities with child #1 and child #2, and had engaged in multiple instances of prohibited sexual contact with more than one child.\u00a0 121 H. 92 (App.), 214 P.3d 1082 (2009)."
