California, the statute prohibited non-obscene as well as obscene materials.\"\u00a0 The constitutionality of the section is on appeal but the legislature found \"that any question as to what is being prohibited should be clarified.\"\u00a0 House Conference Committee Report No. 4, Senate Conference Committee Report No. 3.\n\u00a0 Act 91, Session Laws 1988, amended \u00a7707-750 by reclassifying the offense of promoting child abuse in the first degree from a class B felony to a class A felony. \u00a0The legislature found that victims of child abuse are the least able to defend themselves, and the resulting emotional scars of these victims increase the likelihood of further contact with the criminal justice system; therefore, a more severe punishment for this offense is warranted.\u00a0 The legislature also found that reclassifying this offense will make the classification consistent with the current penalty for sexual abuse in the first degree involving a minor.\u00a0 House Standing Committee Report No. 481-88, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2545.\n\u00a0 Act 363, Session Laws 1997, amended \u00a7\u00a7707-750 and 707-751 to include persons producing or making pornographic material involving minors under the offense of child abuse.\u00a0 The legislature found that under existing child abuse laws, in order for a person to be charged with child abuse, the pornographic materials must show a minor engaged in or assisting others to engage in a sexual act.\u00a0 This loophole in the law allowed persons producing those materials to exploit children by using them in sexually explicit poses without technically violating the law. The legislature believed that it was important to extend the scope of the offense of child abuse to include producing material in which children are exploited through sexually explicit conduct.\n\u00a0 The Act also, inter alia, amended the definition of \"sexual conduct\" to include lascivious exhibition of the genital or pubic area of a minor, and added the definitions of \"lascivious\" and \"community standards,\" in both \u00a7\u00a7707-750 and 707-751.\u00a0 Section 707-751 was also amended to include possession of pornographic material involving children as an offense.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 757, House Standing Committee Report No. 1214.\n\u00a0 Act 200, Session Laws 2002, amended \u00a7\u00a7707-750 and 707-751 by, among other things, defining \"child pornography\" to encompass computer-generated representations of minors.\u00a0 The legislature found that Act 200 addressed the problem of utilizing computer technology in committing crimes against children.\u00a0 House Standing Committee Report No. 417-02, Conference Committee Report No. 36-02.\n\u00a0 Act 212, Session Laws 2012, amended \u00a7707-751 to provide greater protection for children by addressing instances of possession of particularly violent or egregious child pornography.\u00a0 Specifically, Act 212 amended the offense of promoting child abuse in the second degree to include possession of thirty or more images of child pornography where the content of at least one image contains a minor younger than the age of twelve, sadomasochistic abuse of a minor, or bestiality involving a minor.\u00a0 The legislature found that child pornography was a permanent record of the actual sexual abuse, exploitation, and assault of innocent and helpless children.\u00a0 The legislature further found that Hawaii's child pornography laws should be strengthened and should distinguish between the various forms of child pornography.\u00a0 Prior to Act 212, possession of any form of child pornography was covered under the offense of promoting child abuse in the third degree, but a violation was only a class C felony. \u00a0Act 212 amended the offense of promoting child abuse in the second degree, a class B felony, to include particularly violent or egregious child pornography.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 24-12.\n\u00a0 Act 16, Session Laws 2016, amended \u00a7\u00a7707-750 and 707-751 by amending the definition of the term \"sexual conduct\" as that term is used in the Penal Code for the offenses of promoting child abuse in the first and second degrees.\u00a0 The amendments made by Act 16 aligned the term, as used in state law, more closely with the terminology used in federal law by expanding the definition of \"sexual conduct\" to include specific types of conduct.\u00a0 Act 16 also removed unnecessary and archaic language regarding sexual orientation.\u00a0 House Standing Committee Report No. 1124-16."
