[L 1990, c 192, \u00a71; am L 2003, c 66, \u00a72]\n\u00a0\nCross References\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Definition of law enforcement officer, see \u00a7701-118.\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7707-712.5\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Act 192, Session Laws 1990, added this section in an attempt to afford a police officer some additional measure of protection.\u00a0 The legislature noted that this measure may not have any deterrent effect because assaults on police officers usually happen in the heat of the moment.\u00a0 House Standing Committee Report No. 1203-90.\n\u00a0 Act 66, Session Laws 2003, amended this section to upgrade assault against a police officer to a class C felony and expand its scope to cover other law enforcement officers.\u00a0 Under current law, threatening a police officer is a felony, although actual assault of a police officer is a misdemeanor.\u00a0 It is a class C felony to assault correctional workers or educational workers who are engaged in the performance of their duties.\u00a0 The legislative intent was to deter the rising number of assaults committed against correctional officers each year, and to give educational workers added protection.\u00a0 The legislature believed that law enforcement officers deserved the same protection and deterrent methods as these other workers.\u00a0 The legislature expressed the intent that the term \"law enforcement officer\" includes, but is not limited to, police officers, sheriffs, sheriff deputies, department of land and natural resources enforcement officers, and investigators with the department of the attorney general.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 979.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Statutory references in oral charge did not cure the omission of essential elements in resisting arrest and assault against a police officer counts of the charge; supreme court unable to reasonably construe oral charge as charging assault against a police officer.\u00a0 77 H. 309, 884 P.2d 372 (1994).\n\u00a0 As this section does not specifically state that the convicted \"shall serve\" the minimum sentence of thirty days imprisonment, nor explicitly limit the court's ability to suspend part of the minimum sentence, trial court did not err in suspending twenty-five days of the minimum sentence, placing defendant on probation and ordering community service.\u00a0 99 H. 118, 53 P.3d 257 (2002)."
