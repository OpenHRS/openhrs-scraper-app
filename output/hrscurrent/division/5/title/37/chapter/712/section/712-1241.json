provided that sections 54 [amending \u00a7712-1421(1)], 55 [amending \u00a7712-1242(1)], and 56 [repealing \u00a7712-1240.8] shall apply to offenses committed before the effective date of this Act [July 1, 2016]:\n(1)\u00a0 But not yet charged as of its effective date [July 1, 2016];\n(2)\u00a0 Originally charged as a violation of section 712-1240.7 or 712-1240.8, Hawaii Revised Statutes, where the defendant:\n(a)\u00a0 Has not yet been placed in jeopardy or convicted on a plea or verdict; and \n(b)\u00a0 Waives any claim of denial of speedy trial rights for the period elapsing between the date of filing of the original charge and the date of filing of the new charge under this Act;\n(3)\u00a0 Originally charged as a violation of section 712-1240.7 or 712-1240.8, Hawaii Revised Statutes, for which the defendant has been convicted on a plea or verdict, but not yet sentenced, in which case the defendant shall be sentenced pursuant to this Act; and\n(4)\u00a0 Originally charged as a violation of section 712-1240.7 or 712-1240.8, Hawaii Revised Statutes, for which the defendant has been convicted on a plea or verdict and sentenced but for which no final judgment on appeal has been entered, in which case the appellate court shall either:\n(a)\u00a0 Remand the case for sentencing pursuant to this Act if the judgment is affirmed on appeal or if the sentence is vacated; or\n(b)\u00a0 Remand the case for further proceedings pursuant to this Act if the judgment is reversed and remanded for further proceedings.\"\n\u00a0\nRevision Note\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 In subsection (1)(a)(ii), \"or\" deleted pursuant to \u00a723G-15.\n\u00a0\nCross References\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Sale of sterile syringes for prevention of diseases, see \u00a7325-21.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Proscription of distribution of lysergic acid diethylamine cannot be extended by analogy to distribution of lysergic acid diethylamide.\u00a0 61 H. 74, 595 P.2d 288 (1979).\n\u00a0 Crime of promoting dangerous drug by distributing same is complete upon offer to sell the contraband; actual delivery or chemical analysis not required.\u00a0 63 H. 77, 621 P.2d 364 (1980).\n\u00a0 Nothing in subsection (1)(b)(ii)(A) required that defendant \"[possess] at any one time\" one-eighth ounce or more of a cocaine-containing substance or that the substance be delivered all at once in a \"single container\"; undercover police officer\u0092s testimony constituted substantial evidence supporting jury\u0092s verdict finding defendant guilty.\u00a0 77 H. 72, 881 P.2d 1218 (1994).\n\u00a0 Conviction vacated where proof that defendant possessed an aggregate weight of one ounce or more of cocaine not supported by substantial and admissible evidence.\u00a0 80 H. 382, 910 P.2d 695 (1996).\n\u00a0 Notwithstanding the use of the terms \"mixture\" and \"weight\" in subsection (1)(b)(ii)(B), dangerous drugs distributed in liquid form must be measured in fluid ounces.\u00a0 90 H. 255, 978 P.2d 693 (1999).\n\u00a0 Disregarding the erroneously admitted testimony of the police criminalist as to the weight of the substances, the record was devoid of any evidence of the requisite weight of the methamphetamine, a material element of the offenses charged; because those material elements of the offenses were not supported by substantial and admissible evidence, prosecution failed to adduce sufficient evidence to prove every element of the offenses beyond a reasonable doubt.\u00a0 115 H. 343, 167 P.3d 336 (2007).\n\u00a0 Defendants did not prove entrapment under \u00a7702-237(1)(b) by preponderance of evidence as required by \u00a7701-115(2)(b); officer's conduct merely provided defendants with opportunity to commit offense of promoting a dangerous drug in the first degree.\u00a0 82 H. 499 (App.), 923 P.2d 916 (1996).\n\u00a0 There was insufficient evidence that defendant took a substantial step toward the distribution of at least one-eighth ounce of methamphetamine in defendant's possession where there was no evidence that defendant had engaged in negotiations, offered, or agreed to distribute any of the methamphetamine found in defendant's possession.\u00a0 107 H. 144 (App.), 111 P.3d 39 (2005).\n\u00a0 The legislature did not intend to authorize the imposition of multiple punishments for both possession and attempted distribution under this section, where the convictions are based on a defendant's possession of the same drugs at the same moment in time.\u00a0 115 H. 364 (App.), 167 P.3d 739 (2007).\n\u00a0 Cited:\u00a0 700 F. Supp. 2d 1252 (2010).\n\u00a0 Mentioned:\u00a0 74 H. 161, 840 P.2d 358 (1992)."
