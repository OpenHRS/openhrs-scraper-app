In other words, though the speech itself be under the first amendment, the manner of its exercise or its collateral aspects may fall beyond the scope of the amendment.[1]\nAnd Mr. Justice Stewart, after underscoring the sanctity of freedom of expression, remarked in his Ginsburg dissent that:\n\u00a0 Different constitutional questions would arise in a case involving an assault upon individual privacy by publication in a man\u00adner so blatant or obtrusive as to make it difficult or impossible for an unwilling indi\u00advidual to avoid exposure to it.[2]\n\u00a0 Displaying indecent matter is a petty misde\u00admeanor.\u00a0 This relatively light penalty is based on the small amount of harm done, but it is thought desir\u00adable to have a brief jail sentence available as an unpleasant reminder that society does not favor such conduct.\u00a0 The section requires the mental state of knowledge or recklessness as a minimum basis for prosecution. Thus negligence would be insuffi\u00adcient.\u00a0 This is in accord with United States Supreme Court case law in the area of dissemination of obscene books? The area of prohibited display is limited to areas which the general public cannot avoid if affronted by the display. Thus it is not as broad as the definition of \"public place\" in \u00a7711\u00ad-1100(2).\n\u00a0 Section 712-1211 contains special requirements that the display be presented in such a manner as to exploit lust and that it be utterly without redeeming social importance. Arguably neither requirement is constitutionally necessary because of the limited area of prohibition, but particularly since certain works of art would otherwise be included it seems wise to include such a limitation on liability.\n\u00a0\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON \u00a7712-1211\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Act 106, Session Laws 1981, amended subsection (1)(c) to conform to the revised definition of \"pornographic\" in \u00a7712-1210.\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7712-1211 Commentary:\n1.\u00a0 Brennan, The Supreme Court and the Meiklejohn Interpretation of the First Amendment, 79 Harv.
