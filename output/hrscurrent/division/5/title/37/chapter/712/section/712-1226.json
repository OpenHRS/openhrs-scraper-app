[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; am L 1973, c 201, pt of \u00a71; gen ch 1993]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7\u00a7712-1224 TO 712-1226\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 These sections enlarge the scope of the previous law by adding inchoate gambling offenses involving the possession of gambling records or devices, thus permitting police intervention at the anticipatory stage of gambling.\u00a0 The sections also complement and bolster the coverage of \u00a7\u00a7712-1221, 1222, and 1223.\n\u00a0 Sections 712-1224 and 1225 concern the possession of gambling records.\u00a0 These records may consist of any writing, paper, instrument, or article of a kind \"commonly used\" in a bookmaking, lottery, or mutuel scheme.\u00a0 The gradation of penalties into a class C felony and a misdemeanor is made on the same basis as the gradation of penalties for promoting gambling activities (\u00a7\u00a7712-1221 and 1222).\n\u00a0 Section 712-1226 makes it a misdemeanor to manufacture, sell, transport, or possess a gambling device, knowing it is to be used in the advancement of gambling activity which is not social gambling.\u00a0 The term \"gambling device\" is defined by \u00a7712-1220(5).\u00a0 The definition specifically excludes from its scope lottery tickets to avoid needless overlapping of \u00a7\u00a7712-1224 and 1225 with \u00a7712-1226.\n\u00a0 These sections are needed and justifiable for two reasons.\u00a0 First, because of the nature of gambling offenses, the State often cannot prove the actual promotion of gambling activity while at the same time it can easily prove the culpable possession of gambling records or devices.\u00a0 In view of the defense afforded by \u00a7712-1227, possession of gambling records and devices provides a legitimate basis for permitting police intervention and imposing penal liability.\u00a0 Secondly, by allowing the State to prosecute for possession of records or devices, society is able to restrict unlawful gambling activity while it is in its preparatory stage.\u00a0 Especially is this so when the definition of the possessory offense relating to gambling devices is drawn so as to cover trafficking in the devices.\n\u00a0 The coverage of the previous statutory law is sketchy in regard to the possession of gambling records or devices.\u00a0 A person found in possession of a lottery ticket was guilty of a misdemeanor.[1]\u00a0 There was no express provision penalizing possession of bookmaking records or receipts or gambling devices.\u00a0 The Code fills this gap and provides a basis for earlier police intervention.\n\u00a0 The existing case law holds that operating a pinball machine that gives free games upon the scoring of a certain amount of points is a form of gambling.[2]\u00a0 The Proposed Draft of the Code, as well as the Code when adopted in 1972, accepted this position.\u00a0 Originally, \"gambling\" turned on the possibility of receiving something of value.[3]\u00a0 \"Something of value\" included \"a privilege of playing at a game or scheme without charge.\"\u00a0 Thus, possession of a pinball machine originally came within the scope of \u00a7712-1225.\u00a0 However, by Act 201, Session Laws 1973, the legislature amended the definition of \"something of value\" by removing the phrase \"or a privilege of playing at a game or scheme without charge.\"\u00a0 (See \u00a7712-1220(11), and Commentary thereon.)\u00a0 In commenting on the amendment, the Senate Committee on Judiciary, in Standing Committee Report No. 806 (1973) stated:\n\u00a0 This phrase refers to such activities as pinball and other games involving the winning of a privilege of playing another game without charge.\u00a0 Such winnings were previously allowed under Hawaii law.\u00a0 Your Committee finds that there is no good reason to include 'free game' as something of value from gambling.\n\u00a0 These three sections were originally numbered as \u00a7\u00a7712-1223, 1224 and 1225 in the Code when adopted in 1972.\u00a0 They were renumbered by Act 201, Session Laws 1973.\u00a0 Act 201 also made the following changes to these sections.\u00a0 In \u00a7\u00a7712-1224 and 1225, the phrase \"other than as a player\" was deleted, so that even a person who is a player may be subject to the offense of possession of gambling records.\u00a0 Also, in \u00a7712-1224, the clause \"and constituting, reflecting, or representing more than 500 plays or chances therein\" was inserted to describe the type of records of lottery or mutuel scheme that is necessary for the offense of possession of gambling records in the first degree.\n\u00a0\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON \u00a7\u00a7712-1224 TO 712-1226\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Act 174, Session Laws 1980, amended \u00a7712-1224 by expanding the offense to include persons who produce or distribute gambling records and by clarifying the definition and monetary amounts of such records.\u00a0 The purpose was to provide for more effective enforcement and to curb the number of pool tickets for extremely high amounts.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 857-80, House Standing Committee Report No. 492-80.\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7\u00a7712-1224 To 712-1226 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 H.R.S. \u00a7746-3.\n\u00a0\n2.\u00a0 Territory of Hawaii v. Uyehara, 42 Haw. 184 (1957); Territory of Hawaii v. Naumu, 43 Haw. 66 (1958).\n\u00a0\n3.\u00a0 \u00a7712-1220(4)."
