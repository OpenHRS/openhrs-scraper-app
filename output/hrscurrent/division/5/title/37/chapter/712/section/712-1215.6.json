[L 2012, c 213, pt of \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7\u00a7712-1215.5 AND 712-1215.6\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Act 213, Session Laws 2012, added \u00a7\u00a7712-1215.5 and 712-1215.6 to address the problem of \"sexting,\" which involved minors taking nude pictures and videos of themselves or other minors, and transmitting the nude images to others by use of a cell phone or other form of electronic communication.\u00a0 Specifically, Act 213 prohibited:\u00a0 (1) adults from soliciting minors to electronically transmit nude images of minors by making such conduct a misdemeanor [(\u00a7712-1215.5)]; (2) minors from electronically transmitting nude images of themselves or other minors, or soliciting other minors to do so by making such conduct a petty misdemeanor [(\u00a7712-1215.6)]; and (3)\u00a0a person from possessing a nude image transmitted by a minor, but making it an affirmative defense that the recipient made reasonable efforts to destroy the transmitted nude image [(\u00a7712-1215.6)].\u00a0 The legislature found that the electronic transmission of youth-produced sexual pictures and videos was a growing problem, particularly because the images can be shared with many people almost instantaneously.\u00a0 Once transmitted, the original transmitter had very limited ability to control or prevent further dissemination.\u00a0 The legislature further found that the images may be used as a commodity for exchange, and the threatened dissemination of these images may be used as leverage against the subject to force the subject to engage in behaviors that may cause embarrassment, at minimum, and possible mental or emotional harm.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 25-12."
