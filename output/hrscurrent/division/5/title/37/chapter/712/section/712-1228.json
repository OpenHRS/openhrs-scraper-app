[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; am L 1973, c 201, pt of \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nCross References\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Prima facie evidence, see \u00a7701-112.\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7712-1228\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Offenses of possession of gambling records and gambling devices pose a special problem regarding proof of the requisite knowledge of the contents and character of the records or the device.\u00a0 In cases which require proof of the occurrence of sporting events, strict adherence to the rules of evidence would force the prosecution in its case in chief to incur great expense on an issue which may not realistically be in controversy.\u00a0 Therefore, this section provides two evidentiary rules designed to let the prosecutor get the case to the jury in situations where direct evidence is difficult or expensive to obtain and the weight of the logical inference in each situation is sufficient to warrant the special rule.\n\u00a0 Act 201, Session Laws 1973, renumbered this section from \u00a7712-1227 to \u00a7712-1228."
