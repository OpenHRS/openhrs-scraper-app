Utah.[1]\n\u00a0 The definition of this offense limits its application to cases where the victim is under 18 years of age.\u00a0 This limit is set on the theory that in modern society persons 18 and 19 years of age are not, by virtue of their minority status, especially susceptible to the adverse effects which result from breaches of civil duties relating to the welfare of minors.\u00a0 If the behavior of the parent or guardian presents a serious danger to the minor, another offense, addressed specifically to the danger, can be employed, e.g., assault, reckless endangering, etc.\n\u00a0 Previous Hawaii law reflected the standard failure to distinguish the broad jurisdiction of the Family Court[2] from that conduct of adults toward children which ought properly to be regarded as criminal.\u00a0 The governing section provided:\n\u00a0 Any parent, or legal guardian, or person having the custody of any minor within the purview of chapter 571 establishing the Family Court, or any other person who knowingly or wilfully encourages, aids, causes, abets, or connives at the acts or does anything that directly produces, promotes, or contributes to the conditions which bring the minor within the purview of chapter 571, or who wilfully neglects to do that which will directly tend to prevent the acts or conditions that bring the minor within the purview of chapter 571, shall be fined not more than $200 or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.[3]\nThe vagueness and lack of specificity was aggravated by a provision that the above section be construed liberally, i.e., to extend liability.[4]\n\u00a0 The Code provides a degree of specificity by requiring that, for liability to attach, the actor must violate a legal duty of care or protection.\u00a0 The scope of the section is limited, necessarily, to those persons (parents, guardian, or others) charged with the care and custody of the minor.\n\u00a0\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON \u00a7709-904\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Act 198, Session Laws 1974, amended this section so as to apply to a parent, guardian, or other person whether or not charged with the custody of a minor and so as to include the interference with, as well as the violation of, any legal duty of care or protection owed to the minor.\n\u00a0 In Standing Committee Report No. 130-74 the Senate Judiciary Committee stated:\n\u00a0 It will be possible to prosecute persons who harbor runaway juveniles and who assist them in any illegal activities under the rewording of \u00a7709-904.\n\u00a0 Your Committee on Judiciary would also like to emphasize that in the approval of this bill, there is no intent on their part to interfere with the practices and beliefs of the Christian Scientist population of the State of Hawaii.\n\u00a0 Act 314, Session Laws 1986, provided that a person is criminally liable for recklessly allowing another person to inflict serious or substantial bodily injury on a minor. Persons charged with this offense may defend on the ground that they reasonably believed they would incur serious or substantial bodily injury by acting to prevent the harm to the minor. Conference Committee Report No. 51-86.\n\u00a0 Act 230, Session Laws 2006, amended subsection (3) to clarify that endangering the welfare of a minor in the second degree is a misdemeanor.\n\u00a0 Act 249, Session Laws 2006, expanded the crime of endangering the welfare of a minor in the second degree to include causing or permitting a minor to ingest methamphetamine.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 84-06.\n\u00a0 Act 81, Session Laws 2008, amended subsection (1) to include in the offense causing or permitting a minor to inject, ingest, inhale, or otherwise introduce into the minor's body, any controlled substance listed in schedules I through IV not prescribed by a physician, excluding the medical use of marijuana.\u00a0 Act 81 exempted nursing mothers who may cause the ingestion or introduction of detectable amounts of any controlled substance listed in schedules I through IV to their minor children by breastfeeding.\u00a0 The legislature found that the Act would provide greater protection for the health and safety of the children of Hawaii, and was necessary because of the high risk of injury caused by the ingestion of schedule I, II, III, and IV controlled substances.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 55-08, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3415.\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7709-904 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 M.P.C., Tentative Draft No. 9, comments at 183-184 (1959). Cf. Musser v. Utah, 333 U.S. 95 (1948).\u00a0 Among the questionable convictions which have resulted from the vagueness of current statutes, the M.P.C. commentary cites:\u00a0 State v. Davis, 58 Ariz. 444, 120 P.2d 808 (1942) (parent contributed to delinquency of a minor by encouraging, on religious grounds, refusal to salute the flag, which led to child's expulsion from school [but cf. Partain v. State, 77 Okla. Crim. 270, 141 P.2d 124 (1943), holding compulsory flag saluting statutes unconstitutional]); State v. Scallon, 201 La. 1026, 10 So.2d 885 (1942) (\"accused permitted daughter under 17 to go to a nightclub\"); State v. Sobelman, 119 Minn. 232, 271 N.W. 484 (1937) (tavern owner convicted for contributing to the delinquency of 16 year old girl who had been drinking in tavern without owner's knowledge); In re Lewis, 193 Misc. 676, 84 N.Y. Supp. 2d 790 (Children's Ct. 1948) (offense consisted of employing a 15 year old boy \"to work in a bowling alley where the boy was able to see money placed in a desk and succumbed to the temptation to steal\" it); People v. Lew, 78 Cal. App. 2d 178, 177 P.2d 60 (1947) (\"acquittal of statutory rape despite indubitable proof of intercourse; conviction of contributing to delinquency despite clear proof that the girl 'victim' was a prostitute\"); and State v. Harris, 105 W. Va. 165, 141 S.E. 637 (1928) (defendant convicted of contributing to delinquency \"for taking a fifteen-year-old girl out riding against her father's orders and remaining out until eleven o'clock, although the girl asked for the ride\").\n\u00a0\n2.\u00a0 See H.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7571-11 through 571-14.\n\u00a0\n3.\u00a0 H.R.S. \u00a7577-8.\u00a0 In an attempt to eliminate outmoded phrases, the Revisor of Statutes changed the language of R.L.H. \u00a7330-6 (1955) considerably when the Revised Laws were recodified as the Hawaii Revised Statutes [1968].\n\u00a0\n4.\u00a0 Id. \u00a7577-11 which provides:\u00a0 \"Sections 577-8 to 577-11 shall be liberally construed in favor of the State for the purpose of the protection of the child from neglect, or omission of parental duty toward the child by its parents, and further to protect the child from the effects of the improper conduct or acts of any person which may cause, encourage, or contribute to the dependency or delinquency of the child, although the person is in no way related to the child.\""
