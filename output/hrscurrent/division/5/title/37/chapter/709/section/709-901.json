[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; gen ch 1993]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7709-901\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Concealing an infant corpse makes impossible the determination of whether or not criminal conduct was involved in the failure of the fetus to be born alive or in the failure of the infant to continue to live.\u00a0 When an infant corpse is found after it has been hidden, the decomposition of the corpse makes it impossible to determine beyond a reasonable doubt:\u00a0 (1) whether the fetus had been born alive before it met its death (in which case the fetus would be a \"person\" as that term is defined in chapter 707, which covers in part, crimes involving homicide); (2) whether, if born alive, the death resulted from murder, manslaughter, negligent homicide, or other causes; and (3) whether, if not born alive, the pregnancy was terminated by an illegal abortion.\u00a0 Therefore it is advisable to have a residual section making it an offense to conceal the corpse of a new-born child.\n\u00a0 Previous Hawaii law on this subject was too restricted.[1]\u00a0 It seems unwise to limit the offense to cases in which the actor was the mother of the fetus or infant and in which, if born alive, the infant would be illegitimate.\u00a0 Although most cases of concealment might present these circumstances, it seems entirely possible that some cases might not.\u00a0 An infant or fetus conceived in wedlock may be concealed by its mother or some other individual.\u00a0 Moreover, the Code rejects limiting the offense to conduct of the mother only.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [A] limitation of coverage to the mother is unwise, since someone else may conceal the birth.\u00a0 Of course, if the mother and a relative or friend conspire to conceal the birth, accomplice responsibility brings the latter within the ambit of criminal law.\u00a0 But cases are on record in other states in which[,] without the knowledge of the mother and while she was still disoriented because of the childbirth process, relatives have taken the fetus away and concealed it.\u00a0 Accomplice responsibility does not arise in this case, but the need for inclusion is obvious.[2]\n\u00a0 The Code enlarges the offense and eliminates restrictions in its coverage which seem clearly inconsistent with its purpose.\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7709-901 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 H.R.S. \u00a7768-8, which provided:\u00a0 \"If any woman conceals the death of any issue of her body, whether born alive or not, which, if born alive, would have been illegitimate, so that it may not be known whether the issue was born alive or not, or whether it was murdered, she shall be fined not more than $100 and imprisoned at hard labor not more than two years.\"\n\u00a0\n2.\u00a0 Prop. Mich. Rev. Cr. Code, comments at 500."
