[the committed person's] insanity.\"[1]\u00a0 The mandatory requirement of an independent review before change in commitment or conditional release status is an addition to the law.\u00a0 It affords the defendant and the public a more deliberate determination of the application.\n\u00a0\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON \u00a7704-414\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 In conformity with the changes made in \u00a7\u00a7704-404 and 411, Act 54, Session Laws 1974, also changed \u00a7704-414 to permit the use of one certified clinical psychologist as part of the examination panel.\n\u00a0 Act 3, Session Laws 1979, modified the requirements for the composition of examination panels to allow the courts greater flexibility in appointing mental health professionals.\n\u00a0 Act 314, Session Laws 1986, amended \"certified clinical psychologists\" to \"licensed psychologists.\"\u00a0 This change was made because psychologists are licensed and not certified and the term \"clinical\" does not accurately describe psychologists qualified to determine penal responsibility and fitness to proceed.\u00a0 Act 314 also provided an exception to the licensure requirement which recognizes that under \u00a7465-3(4), psychologists employed under government certification or civil service rules are exempt from the licensure requirement.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 51-86.\n\u00a0 Act 145, Session Laws 1987, permitted the department of health to set minimum standards for participation and appointment of a sanity examiner.\u00a0 The legislature felt this change would allow additional assurances of higher quality testimony by these examiners.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 691, House Standing Committee Report No. 1217.\n\u00a0 Act 305, Session Laws 1988, included licensed psychologists among the professionals which may provide offender examination services to the Hawaii criminal justice system.\u00a0 The legislature stated that the present laws, which permit only psychiatric evaluation, are inconsistent with the many and varied uses the court has found for the services of licensed psychologists.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2153.\n\u00a0 Act 88, Session Laws 1992, made technical amendments to the section for purposes of clarity, consistency, and style.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2579.\n\u00a0 Act 306, Session Laws 1997, amended this section to allow mental health examinations to be conducted by one rather than three examiners in nonfelony cases, and to require three examiners, which include at least one psychiatrist and one psychologist, in felony cases.\u00a0 The amendment streamlines the process for committing and releasing mentally incompetent defendants.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 64.\n\u00a0 Act 230, Session Laws 2006, amended this section by omitting in the sixth sentence, the words \"and participate in\" from the phrase that formerly read \"to witness and participate in the examination.\"\n\u00a0 Act 198, Session Laws 2016, amended this section by making conforming amendments.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2261.\u00a0 Act 198 also amended this section by adding the definition of \"qualified physician.\"\n\u00a0 Act 231, Session Laws 2016, amended this section to implement recommendations made by the Penal Code Review Committee convened pursuant to House Concurrent Resolution No. 155, S.D. 1 (2015).\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7704-414 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 H.R.S. \u00a7711-94."
