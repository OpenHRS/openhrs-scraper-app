[the defendant] has regained his sanity at the time of acquittal, the judge may release such person without... commital [sic],\"[3] fell short of the flexibility and safeguards provided in the Code.\u00a0 By making dangerousness the relevant criterion, the Code provides for possible commitment of a dangerous person even though the person's physical or mental condition at the time of commitment does not preclude penal responsibility.\u00a0 Furthermore, the Code specifically provides that the court, the prosecution, or the defendant may move for a separate post-acquittal hearing directed to the limited issue of present dangerousness.\u00a0 Consistent with the concept of tailoring the disposition of the irresponsible defendant to the condition of the defendant and the protection of others, the Code also recognizes conditional release (in addition to commitment and discharge) and provides for physical as well as mental conditions which preclude responsibility.\n\u00a0\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON \u00a7704-411\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Act 54, Session Laws 1974, amended subsection (3) to permit the use of a certified clinical psychologist as a member of the examination panel.\n\u00a0 Act 3, Session Laws 1979, amended subsection (3) by modifying the requirements for the composition of examination panels to allow the courts greater flexibility in appointing mental health professionals.\n\u00a0 Act 281, Session Laws 1983, amended subsection (1)(a) so that defendants charged with nonviolent crimes who are acquitted pursuant to chapter 704, may be placed in the least restrictive environment which takes into account the defendant's treatment needs and the need to prevent harm to the defendant and others. Also, subsections (1) and (2) were amended to delete a person's \"danger to property\" as a criteria justifying commitment, based on Suzuki v. Yuen, 617 F.2d 173 (9th Cir. 1980), in which the court found that criteria unconstitutionally broad.\u00a0 House Conference Committee Report No. 27.\n\u00a0 Act 314, Session Laws 1986, amended \"certified clinical psychologists\" to \"licensed psychologists.\"\u00a0 This change was made because psychologists are licensed and not certified and the term \"clinical\" does not accurately describe psychologists qualified to determine penal responsibility and fitness to proceed.\u00a0 Act 314 also provided an exception to the licensure requirement which recognizes that under \u00a7465-3(4), psychologists employed under government certification or civil service rules are exempt from the licensure requirement.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 51-86.\n\u00a0 Act 145, Session Laws 1987, permitted the department of health to set minimum standards for participation and appointment of a sanity examiner.\u00a0 The legislature felt this change would allow additional assurances of higher quality testimony by these examiners.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 691, House Standing Committee Report No. 1217.\n\u00a0 Act 305, Session Laws 1988, included licensed psychologists among the professionals which may provide offender examination services to the Hawaii criminal justice system.\u00a0 The legislature stated that the present laws, which permit only psychiatric evaluation, are inconsistent with the many and varied uses the court has found for the services of licensed psychologists.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2153.\n\u00a0 Act 88, Session Laws 1992, made technical amendments to the section for purposes of clarity, consistency, and style.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2579.\n\u00a0 Act 306, Session Laws 1997, amended subsection (3) by, inter alia, allowing mental health examinations to be conducted by one rather than three examiners in nonfelony cases; the courts are allowed to appoint either a psychiatrist or a licensed psychologist as the examiner.\u00a0 In felony cases, three examiners are required, including at least one psychiatrist and one psychologist.\u00a0 The Act also limited the time period during which a defendant, if not then confined, may be committed by the court for examination, to not more than thirty days unless the court determines it necessary upon written findings. \u00a0The amendment streamlines the process for committing and releasing mentally incompetent defendants.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 64.\n\u00a0 Act 230, Session Laws 2006, amended this section to, among other things, require that in a post-acquittal hearing, a defendant's fitness shall not be an issue for a defendant who has been acquitted on the grounds of physical or mental disease, disorder, or defect.\u00a0 House Standing Committee Report No. 665-06.\n\u00a0 Act 99, Session Laws 2008, amended subsection (1) by requiring the county police departments to provide to the director of health and a defendant who is committed to the custody of the director, copies of certain police reports regarding that defendant.\u00a0 Act 99 expedited the records disclosure process for clinical evaluation purposes while protecting a patient's right of privacy.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 161-08.\n\u00a0 Act 100, Session Laws 2008, amended this section by authorizing the director of health or a committed person to apply to the court to conduct a hearing to assess any further need for inpatient hospitalization of a person who is acquitted on the ground of physical or mental disease, disorder, or defect excluding responsibility.\u00a0 Act 100 also required the court to complete the hearing process and render a decision within sixty days of the application, provided that for good cause, the court may extend the sixty day time frame upon the request of the director of health or the committed person.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 37-08.\n\u00a0 Act 127, Session Laws 2009, amended this section by repealing subsections (5), (6), and (7), which had been interpreted as having established an additional hearing and application procedure for persons committed to the Hawaii state hospital due to an acquittal based on the ground of physical or mental disease, disorder, or defect excluding responsibility.\u00a0 The repeal of the subsections clarified that \u00a7704-412 governs the timing and standards for conditional release or discharge from the custody of the director of health.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 533.\n\u00a0 Act 99, Session Laws 2011, established a maximum one-year period of post-acquittal conditional release for persons charged with a petty misdemeanor, misdemeanor, or violation to promote the efficient use of criminal justice resources.\u00a0 The legislature found that although persons acquitted of criminal charges by reason of physical or mental disease, disorder, or defect may be released to the community on a post-acquittal conditional release after a court determines that the persons can be adequately controlled and given proper care, supervision, and treatment, there are many instances where people remain on conditional release far longer than the maximum penalty allowed for the offense charged.\u00a0 According to the department of health, ninety per cent of persons on conditional release in Hawaii for a misdemeanor or petty misdemeanor are kept on conditional release longer than they would have spent on maximum jail time or on probation for the same offense, sometimes up to twenty times longer.\u00a0 This increases the burden on staff and financial resources at district courts, probation offices, mental health centers, and hospitals.\u00a0 By establishing a specific time limit on the conditional release of persons charged with lesser offenses, Act 99 increases the availability of resources for more serious offenders.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1170.\n\u00a0 Act 198, Session Laws 2016, amended this section by making conforming amendments.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2261.\u00a0 Act 198 also amended this section by adding the definition of \"qualified physician.\"\n\u00a0 Act 231, Session Laws 2016, amended subsections (1) and (3) to implement recommendations made by the Penal Code Review Committee convened pursuant to House Concurrent Resolution No. 155, S.D. 1 (2015).\n\u00a0\nLaw Journals and Reviews\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Unfair Punishment of the Mentally Disabled?\u00a0 The Constitutionality of Treating Extremely Dangerous and Mentally Ill Insanity Acquittees in Prison Facilities.\u00a0 23 UH L.
