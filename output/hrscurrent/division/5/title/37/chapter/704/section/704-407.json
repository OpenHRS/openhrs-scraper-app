[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; am L 1980, c 222, \u00a71(2); gen ch 1993; am L 2006, c 230, \u00a78; am L 2016, c 231, \u00a77]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7704-407\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 This section affords the defendant and the defendant's counsel the opportunity, notwithstanding the defendant's unfitness to proceed, to make any objection to the prosecution which is susceptible of a fair determination without the personal participation of the defendant.\u00a0 It seems clear that this is an eminently sensible provision in view of the fact that it is the defendant's inability to participate in the defendant's defense (either because the defendant lacks capacity to either understand the proceedings or to assist in the defendant's own defense) that has rendered the defendant unfit to be proceeded against.\u00a0 If a valid objection to the continuance of the prosecution can be established without the participation of the defendant, there is no reason not to terminate it.\n\u00a0 This section is an addition to the law.\u00a0 The concept was originally proposed by the Massachusetts Judicial Council[1] and adopted as an optional alternative by the Model Penal Code.[2]\n\u00a0\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON \u00a7704-407\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Act 222, Session Laws 1980, eliminated post-commitment release motions based upon factual grounds and limited such motions to those based upon legal grounds.\u00a0 The intent was to have all factual issues, including insanity, heard in one trial.\n\u00a0 Act 230, Session Laws 2006, amended this section to, among other things, allow the court to order the release of the defendant on conditions, subject to the law governing involuntary outpatient treatment.\n\u00a0 Act 231, Session Laws 2016, amended subsection (3) to implement recommendations made by the Penal Code Review Committee convened pursuant to House Concurrent Resolution No. 155, S.D. 1 (2015).\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7704-407 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 Massachusetts Judicial Council, Thirty-Sixth Report 22-24, 27-28 (1960).\n\u00a0\n2.\u00a0 M.P.C. \u00a74.06.\u00a0 The other alternative is to limit post- commitment hearings to legal objections to the prosecution which are susceptible of a determination prior to trial."
