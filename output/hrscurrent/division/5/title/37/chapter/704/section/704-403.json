[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; gen ch 1993]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7704-403\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 The section sets forth the universally accepted position in Anglo-American law that a defendant cannot be proceeded against (with the exception of being charged) unless the defendant has the capacity to understand the proceedings against the defendant and assist in the defendant's own defense.\u00a0 The Code deliberately avoids terms such as \"the then present insanity\"[1] and focuses on those factors which call for a suspension of the proceedings:\u00a0 (1) lack of capacity to understand the proceedings, or (2) lack of capacity to assist in the defense.\n\u00a0 Previous Hawaii law is substantially in accord with this section except that the statutory language used vague, unfocused phrases such as \"the then present insanity or mental irresponsibility of the accused,\" and \"the then existing... mental irresponsibility.\"[2]\u00a0 However, in actual application the trial courts have focused on the capacity of the defendant to understand the proceedings and to assist in the defense.[3]\n\u00a0\nLaw Journals and Reviews\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Fitness to Proceed:\u00a0 Compassion or Prejudice?\u00a0 II HBJ, no. 13, at 135 (1998).\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Facts did not support a finding that petitioner was mentally incompetent at relevant times.\u00a0 79 H. 118 (App.), 899 P.2d 401 (1995).\n\u00a0 Cited:\u00a0 60 H. 17, 586 P.2d 1028 (1978).\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7704-403 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 See H.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7711-91 and 711-92.\n\u00a0\n2.\u00a0 Id.\n\u00a0\n3.\u00a0 See State v.
