[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7704-405\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 This section departs from the prior law[1] and provides that the issue of the defendant's fitness to proceed will be determined solely by the court.\u00a0 In this the Code follows the Model Penal Code.[2]\u00a0 The fitness of the defendant to proceed is only tangentially related to the defendant's condition at the time of the conduct alleged and the defendant's responsibility for that conduct.\u00a0 Moreover, there might be several periodic hearings on the question of the defendant's fitness to be proceeded against.\u00a0 It seems unwise to afford the defendant a jury determination in each instance.\n\u00a0 The Code also allows the court to make a determination of fitness to proceed on the basis of an uncontested report; which is in accord with prior law in felony cases.[3]\u00a0 The last sentence of this section allows a limited exception to the hearsay rule so that the report of an examining expert may be received in evidence without the necessity of calling the expert to the stand.\u00a0 The exception is not inconsistent with the purpose of the hearsay rule because the defendant is assured of the right to summon and to cross-examine the reporting examiner if the defendant wishes.\n\u00a0\nLaw Journals and Reviews\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Fitness to Proceed:\u00a0 Compassion or Prejudice?\u00a0 II HBJ, no. 13, at 135 (1998).\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Consideration of the sanity commission report is permissible use of hearsay.\u00a0 63 H. 186, 623 P.2d 881 (1981).\n\u00a0 Where defendant's counsel declined to call and cross-examine the doctors who prepared the sanity report, counsel waived defendant's right of confrontation.\u00a0 63 H. 186, 623 P.2d 881 (1981).\n\u00a0 Cited:\u00a0 60 H. 17, 586 P.2d 1028 (1978).\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7704-405 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 H.R.S. \u00a7711-91.\n\u00a0\n2.\u00a0 M.P.C. \u00a74.06.\n\u00a0\n3.\u00a0 See H.R.S. \u00a7711-91, which reads in part:\u00a0 \"If the court deems such report conclusive of the then present insanity... of the accused, the court may allow a nolle prosequi to be entered in the case, and in such case shall forthwith, without other or further proceedings, adjudge the accused to be insane and commit him to the state hospital until discharged as provided by law....\""
