[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; gen ch 1993]\n\u00a0\nCross References\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Physician-patient privilege, psychologist-client privilege, see \u00a7626-1, rules 504 and 504.1.\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7704-416\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 The Code takes the position that statements made by the defendant to an examiner in the course of an examination under this chapter should be admissible in penal proceedings on the issue of the defendant's physical or mental condition notwithstanding any privilege which might be imported from the law of evidence.[1]\u00a0 However, \"to safeguard the defendant's rights and to make possible the feeling of confidence essential for effective psychiatric [and other medical] diagnosis or treatment, the defendant's statements made for this purpose may not be put in evidence on any other issue,\"[2] e.g., whether the defendant in fact engaged in the proscribed conduct, in penal proceedings.\n\u00a0 The final clause of this section provides that any statement made for the purpose of examination and treatment pursuant to this chapter, which constitutes an admission of guilt of the offense charged, in addition to being inadmissible on other issues, will also not be admissible in evidence on the issue of defendant's mental or physical condition.\u00a0 The intent of the Code is to meet two problems:\u00a0 (1) the inability of a jury to divorce a statement containing an admission of guilt from the determination of all issues, and (2) an objection to the examination of the defendant on the basis of defendant's privilege against self-incrimination.[3]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Error to admit defendant's statement to physician to attack defendant's credibility; cannot be said error harmless.\u00a0 69 H. 68, 733 P.2d 690 (1987).\n\u00a0 Overrides Hawaii rules of evidence rule 702.1.\u00a0 71 H. 591, 801 P.2d 27 (1990).\n\u00a0 Statements not prejudicial where elicited to show declarant's emotional state and no objection made by declarant's counsel.\u00a0 74 H. 141, 838 P.2d 1374 (1992).\n\u00a0 Because the plain language of this section does not address non-statements, and because an ordinary reading of the statute does not produce an absurd result, this section does not govern non-statements.\u00a0 116 H. 200, 172 P.3d 512 (2007).\n\u00a0 Trial court did not err in permitting prosecution to cross-examine defendant regarding defendant's non-statements to defendant's mental examiners where defendant's failure to mention defendant's concerns regarding aliens was clearly relevant to the question of whether defendant was being truthful when defendant testified at trial about having those concerns at the time of the incident, and this section only addresses the admissibility of defendant's statements, not non-statements; thus, as the introduction of defendant's non-statements did not violate this chapter, defendant's right to a fair trial was not prejudiced by admission of the testimony.\u00a0 116 H. 200, 172 P.3d 512 (2007).\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7704-416 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 See H.R.S. \u00a7621-20.5, which also limits the physician-patient privilege to civil proceedings.\n\u00a0\n2.\u00a0 M.P.C., Tentative Draft No. 4, comments at 201 (1955).\n\u00a0\n3.\u00a0 See M.P.C. \u00a74.09, notes at 78 (1962)."
