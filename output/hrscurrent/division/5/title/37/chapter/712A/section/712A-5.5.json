[L 1996, c 104, \u00a72]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7712A-5.5\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Act 104, Session Laws 1996, added this section which specifies the criteria that the court may consider in determining whether a forfeiture is grossly disproportionate to the nature and severity of the owner's conduct.\u00a0 The section applies only to forfeitures instituted under \u00a7712A-5(1)(b) dealing with property used to facilitate an offense or an instrumentality used in an offense.\u00a0 If property were the derivatives or the proceeds of an offense, the property would be tainted and consequently would be forfeited.\u00a0 House Standing Committee Report No. 409-96.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 The State must prove the existence of a substantial connection between the currency being forfeited and the illegal activity; where $1,300 of the subject currency was substantially connected to appellant's illegal gambling activity and \u00a7712A-11(4) provides that the State need not trace the proceeds exactly, $1,300 was properly ordered forfeited to the State.\u00a0 104 H. 323, 89 P.3d 823 (2004).\n\u00a0 Where State failed to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the subject currency of $1,900 seized from appellant's trousers was involved in appellant's gambling transactions, trial court erred in ordering currency forfeited to State; there was no evidence connecting currency to any illegal activity, and absent proof of a substantial connection between the illegal activity and the res, the currency was not subject to forfeiture.\u00a0 104 H. 323, 89 P.3d 823 (2004)."
