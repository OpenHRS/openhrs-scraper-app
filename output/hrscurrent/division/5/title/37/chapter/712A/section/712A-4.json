Act 155, insurance fraud and Act 307, unauthorized entry into motor vehicle.\u00a0 Act 155 amended the 1997 version of this section.\u00a0 However, Act 307 used the pre-1997 version of the section for amendment, omitting the reference to trademark counterfeiting.\u00a0 The deletion of the brackets around \"trademark counterfeiting.\" by Act 18, Session Laws 1999, ratified the revisor's replacement of \"trademark counterfeiting.\"\u00a0 House Standing Committee Report No. 900, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1239.\n\u00a0 Act 200, Session Laws 2002, amended this section to subject to forfeiture, property used in promoting child abuse and electronic enticement of a child.\u00a0 The legislature found that Act 200 addressed the problem of utilizing computer technology in committing crimes against children.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2867, Conference Committee Report No. 36-02.\n\u00a0 Act 240, Session Laws 2002, amended this section by including sexual exploitation of a minor within covered offenses subject to forfeiture of property upon conviction.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 79-02.\n\u00a0 Act 7, Session Laws 2006, amended this section by adding unlawful methamphetamine trafficking and manufacturing of a controlled substance with a child present to the offenses that are subject to forfeiture.\u00a0 Act 7 clarified that the offenses were originally intended to be a part of the Penal Code's section on forfeiture.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2559, House Standing Committee Report No. 1115-06.\n\u00a0 Act 146, Session Laws 2011, amended this section by adding labor trafficking to the offenses for which property is subject to forfeiture.\n\u00a0 Act 146 established, among other things, a class A and class B felony offense for labor trafficking, an offense for nonpayment of wages, and an offense for unlawful conduct with respect to documents.\u00a0 The legislature found that Hawaii is one of only five states without a specific labor trafficking statute, yet labor trafficking has occurred at an unprecedented level in the State.\u00a0 Act 146 sent an unmistakable warning to individuals and entities engaged in labor trafficking and provided a clearer and more structured means for law enforcement agencies to protect and aid trafficking victims.\u00a0 Also, Act 146 would be a catalyst for law enforcement agencies, service providers, and other state agencies and community organizations to engage in needed training and education on labor trafficking.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 77.\n\u00a0 Act 247, Session Laws 2013, amended this section by adding the offenses of promoting prostitution, solicitation of a minor for prostitution, habitual solicitation of prostitution, and solicitation of prostitution near schools or public parks under the State\u0092s forfeiture laws.\u00a0 The legislature found that Act 247 strengthened the laws and penalties for crimes that exploit children subjected to prostitution.\u00a0 Furthermore, by amending, among other things, the State\u0092s forfeiture laws, Act 247 discouraged individuals from engaging in solicitation of prostitution.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 64.\n\u00a0 Act 206, Session Laws 2016, amended this section to include the offense of sex trafficking in the list of covered offenses for which property is subject to forfeiture.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3450.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Unless the offense is one of those enumerated in paragraphs (b) through (d), the offense must \"specifically authorize forfeiture\" as required by paragraph (a) in order to render the taking of the property lawful; thus, where neither Hawaii administrative rule \u00a713-95-70 nor \u00a713-95-71 specifically authorized forfeiture, appellate court erred in vacating circuit court's orders and judgments regarding forfeiture of boat.\u00a0 119 H. 245, 195 P.3d 1177 (2008)."
