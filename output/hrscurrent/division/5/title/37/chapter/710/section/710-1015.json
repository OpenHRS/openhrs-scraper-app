[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; gen ch 1993]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7710-1015\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 The rationale behind this section is much the same as that behind \u00a7710-1014:\u00a0 it is undesirable that public resources be wasted, and it is possible that harm may occur from the diversion of public resources from legitimate needs.\n\u00a0 The Model Penal Code and most recent state revisions deal with this problem directly.[1]\u00a0 The Code avoids specific listings of what kinds of information may not be falsely related to law-enforcement authorities by penalizing all knowing transmission of false information relating to a crime or other incident within their concern.\u00a0 This proscription would include cases where the crime or incident did not occur and where the report pretends to furnish information which the actor does not have.\n\u00a0 Previous Hawaii law made false reporting to a police officer concerning a crime a misdemeanor.\u00a0 The Code, while retaining the same penalty, broadens and clarifies the definition of the offense.\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7710-1015 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 M.P.C. \u00a7241.5; N.Y.R.P.L. \u00a7240.50; Prop.
