[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; am L 1980, c 267, \u00a72]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7710-1071\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 The potential for harm involved in witness intimidation is essentially similar to that involved in the offense of bribery of a witness, e.g., the undermining of the integrity of an extremely important part of the judicial process.\u00a0 The definition of the offense also parallels that of bribery of a witness, and the sanctions are identical.\u00a0 Note, however, that only the person who directs the force or threat against the witness is guilty of a crime.\u00a0 \"Threat,\" as used in this section is any threat proscribed by the offense of criminal coercion under \u00a7707-724.\u00a0 To some extent, it would seem that the section on criminal coercion might suffice to deal with witness intimidation, but since the intimidation of a witness carries the additional harm of interfering with an official proceeding, it seems appropriate to impose a more severe sanction for the present offense.\n\u00a0 Previous Hawaii law had no provisions dealing specifically with the offense of witness intimidation.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Terroristic threatening not a lesser included offense of intimidating a witness within the meaning of \u00a7701-109(4)(a); multiple conviction of terroristic threatening and intimidating a witness not barred by \u00a7701-109(4)(c).\u00a0 75 H. 517, 865 P.2d 157 (1994).\n\u00a0 Sufficient evidence that defendant directed threats to person whom defendant believed was about to be called as a witness where defendant phoned person soon after explicit warning from police officer that such conduct could be inferred as intimidating a witness.\u00a0 82 H. 419 (App.), 922 P.2d 1032 (1996).\n\u00a0 Sufficient evidence that defendant intended to influence person's testimony by making threatening statements during phone call.\u00a0 82 H. 419 (App.), 922 P.2d 1032 (1996)."
