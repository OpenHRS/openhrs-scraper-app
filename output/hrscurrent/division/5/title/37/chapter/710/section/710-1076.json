[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; gen ch 1993]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7710-1076\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Official proceedings rely on the integrity of physical evidence, in addition to the integrity of witnesses and jurors, to achieve equitable results.\u00a0 To allow the impairment or falsification of physical evidence would undermine greatly the fairness and impartiality of the judicial process.\n\u00a0 This section makes it an offense both to conceal true evidence and to offer false evidence, since to do either would obviously misrepresent the truth which it is the object of the proceeding to determine.\u00a0 In both cases, the actor must have an intent that the concealment or falsification should have an effect in the proceeding.\u00a0 \"Physical evidence\" is defined principally to distinguish it from that evidence which is offered as testimony by witnesses.\n\u00a0 Previous Hawaii law dealt with the offense of tampering with physical evidence under the general heading of supressing evidence.[1]\u00a0 The prior law provided that any person who \"destroys, conceals, or suppresses any deposition or other legal evidence in any suit or proceeding...\"[2] would be subject to a misdemeanor penalty.\u00a0 It had been held that the offense of suppressing evidence is not limited to judicial proceedings.[3]\u00a0 The Code extends the law by specifically covering presentation or fabrication of false physical evidence and any form of tampering when it is believed an official proceeding is about to be instituted.\n\u00a0\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON \u00a7710-1076\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 The Code as adopted differs from the Proposed Draft in that in subsection (1)(a) the words \"or availability\" were deleted after the word \"verity.\"\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7710-1076 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 H.R.S. \u00a7725-4.\n\u00a0\n2.\u00a0 Id.\n\u00a0\n3.\u00a0 Territory v.
