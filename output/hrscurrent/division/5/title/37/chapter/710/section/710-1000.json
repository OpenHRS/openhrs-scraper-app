or\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b)\u00a0 The statement recites that it was made under oath or affirmation, the declarant was aware of such recitation at the time the declarant made the statement and intended that the statement should be represented as a sworn statement, and the statement was in fact so represented by its delivery or utterance with the signed jurat of an officer authorized to administer oaths appended thereto.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Oath required or authorized by law\" means an oath the use of which is specifically provided for by statute or appropriate regulatory provision.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Official proceeding\" means a proceeding heard or which may be heard before any legislative, judicial, administrative, or other governmental agency or official authorized to take evidence under oath, including any referee, hearing examiner, commissioner, notary, or other person taking testimony or deposition in connection with any such proceeding.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Pecuniary benefit\" is benefit in the form of money, property, commercial interests, or anything else the primary significance of which is economic gain.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Public servant\" means any officer or employee of any branch of government, whether elected, appointed, or otherwise employed, and any person participating as advisor, consultant, or otherwise, in performing a governmental function, but the term does not include jurors or witnesses.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Record\" means information that is written or printed, or that is stored in an electronic or other medium and is retrievable in a perceivable form.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Statement\" means any representation, but includes a representation of opinion, belief, or other state of mind only if the representation clearly relates to state of mind apart from or in addition to any facts which are the subject of the representation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Testimony\" includes oral or written statements, documents, or any other material that may be offered by a witness in an official proceeding.

Supp. 1377 (1995).\n\u00a0 \"Custody\" construed.\u00a0 59 H. 456, 583 P.2d 337 (1978).\n\u00a0 The offense of terroristic threatening in the first degree does not require a nexus between the alleged threat and the threatened person's status as a public servant where the threatened person is a government officer or employee; thus, trial court did not err in failing to give a nexus instruction.\u00a0 111 H. 327, 141 P.3d 974 (2006).\n\u00a0 Under paragraph (15), any \"officer or employee of any branch of government\" qualifies as a public servant.\u00a0 105 H. 261 (App.), 96 P.3d 590 (2004).\n\u00a0 Under paragraph (15), a person qualifies as a public servant based on the type of work he or she performs, and not based on when that work is being performed.\u00a0 105 H. 261 (App.), 96 P.3d 590 (2004).\n\u00a0 There was no support for the government's argument that paragraph (3) [defining \"custody\"] sets forth \"elements\" that the prosecution must prove in order to sustain a conviction under \u00a7710-1021; none of the modes of custody set forth in paragraph (3) is an element of the crime of escape from custody.\u00a0 782 F.3d 510 (2015)."
