[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7710-1070\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 As stated in the commentary to perjury and related offenses,[1] the integrity of the witness' testimony is one of the fundamental requisites of our jurisprudential system.\u00a0 However, unlike the case of perjury, attention is here focused upon the step prior to perjury, the inducement for the offense.\u00a0 It is the risk of unreliable and false testimony that is the harm sought to be prevented.\n\u00a0 It is apparent that substantial interference with any part of the process whereby a witness is called to testify in an official proceeding is to be condemned.\u00a0 And since each part of the process is of unique importance in assuring the availability and integrity of the witness, it follows that the sanction ought to be the same regardless of which part of this process is obstructed or perverted.\u00a0 Therefore, it is made an offense to interfere, by means of conferring or receiving a benefit with either testimony, service of process, or appearance at the proceeding.\n\u00a0 Note that the person whom the actor attempts to induce need not actually be a witness, but may merely be one whom the actor believes is about to be called as a witness.\u00a0 This provision is to avoid confusion as to when an individual actually becomes a witness, thus foreclosing specious defenses and emphasizing that the harm inheres in the attempt to interfere with the course of the official proceeding.\n\u00a0 Previous Hawaii law recognized bribery of a witness as a form of suppressing evidence.[2]\u00a0 The section on suppressing evidence, a misdemeanor offense, covered only evading the giving of testimony and suppressing other forms of evidence.\u00a0 Also, it apparently covered only the bribe giver and not the receiver.\u00a0 The misdemeanor sanction was not consistent with the sanction of twenty years' imprisonment permitted by previous law for subornation of perjury.\u00a0 Under this Code, the class C felony sentence provided for the offenses defined in this section is the same as that imposed for perjury.\n\u00a0\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON \u00a7710-1070\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 The Code as adopted differs from the Proposed Draft in that the title of the section was changed to \"bribery of or by a witness\" from \"bribery of a witness.\"\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 The leap from asking a potential witness to \"not show up\" or to \"not show up and testify\" to the conclusion that a defendant thereby intended to induce that witness to avoid service of process was untenable in light of the structure of this section; thus, there was insufficient evidence to lead a person of reasonable caution to the conclusion that defendant intended to induce witness to avoid service of process under subsection (1)(b).\u00a0 117 H. 218, 177 P.3d 928 (2008).\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7710-1070 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 \u00a7\u00a7710-1060, 1061.\n\u00a0\n2.\u00a0 H.R.S. \u00a7725-4."
