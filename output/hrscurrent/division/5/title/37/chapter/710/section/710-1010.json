[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; am L 1980, c 150, \u00a71; am L 1991, c 223, \u00a72; gen ch 1993; am L 2001, c 91, \u00a73; am L 2016, c 164, \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7710-1010\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 This section penalizes intentional interference with any level of government within the State.\u00a0 Subsection (1)(a) is addressed to governmental functions generally, subsection (1)(b) insures that peace officers acting under color of official authority are covered.\u00a0 Although subsection (1)(b) may not be needed, redundancy is to be preferred over ambiguity.\n\u00a0 Two areas are specifically excepted from the operation of this section.\u00a0 The first excepted area, that of the making of an arrest, is covered under \u00a7710-1026 of this chapter.\u00a0 The second exception, that of labor disputes involving the government, is an area of conflicting policies.\nA labor dispute involving government employees ... presents special problems.\u00a0 Without the subsection [(2)(b)] exemption, activities which might constitute no more than tortious unfair labor practices in the context of normal industrial disputes would take on the added burden of criminal liability when the employer interfered with was the Government ...\u00a0 [W]hile such activity should not necessarily be protected, the appropriate sanctions should be determined by labor legislation, not the Criminal Code....[1]\n\u00a0 This section requires that the obstruction be by means of violence, force, or physical interference.\u00a0 The Code takes the position that in many instances of nonfeasance by private individuals, e.g., by a failure to file a report required by law, the possibility of misdemeanor liability is too severe a sanction.\u00a0 In those cases where failure to do some act is attended by a substantial danger of disruption of governmental functions, special sections have been drafted to deal with the problems.[2]\n\u00a0 Previous Hawaii law dealt with obstruction of governmental operations on an ad hoc basis; the previous coverage was somewhat spotty and the cases covered carried different penalties.[3]\u00a0 Under previous law, threats of violence against public officials were penalized as misdemeanors.[4]\u00a0 The Code seeks to extend the coverage of prior law to encompass protection of all governmental functions and to standardize the available penalties.\n\u00a0\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON \u00a7710-1010\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 The Code as adopted by the legislature in 1972 differs from the Proposed Draft in that in subsection (2)(b), the words \"as provided by law\" were inserted after the word \"function.\"\n\u00a0 Act 150, Session Laws 1980, reduced the offense from a misdemeanor to a petty misdemeanor.\u00a0 In view of the relatively light sentences being imposed by the courts, the classification for the offense was changed to a petty misdemeanor in order to keep the cases in the district court, thus reducing the congestion in the circuit court and expediting the disposition of these cases.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 693-80, House Standing Committee Report No. 874-80.\n\u00a0 Act 91, Session Laws 2001, clarified the offense of obstructing government operations by adding the operation of a radio, telephone, television, or other telecommunication system owned or operated by the State or a county.\u00a0 Electronic communications are utilized extensively by State and local governments, i.e., counties.\u00a0 Current law did not cover intentional obstruction, impairment, or hindering of radio, telephone, television, or other telecommunication systems owned or operated by the State or counties.\u00a0 Act 91 closed that gap.\n\u00a0 Also, the term \"peace officer,\" as used in the Penal Code, caused the intermediate court of appeals to question whether the term meant \"law enforcement officer.\"\u00a0 Act 91 resolved the ambiguity by substituting that term for \"peace officer\" [throughout the Penal Code].\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 23.\n\u00a0 Act 164, Session Laws 2016, amended this section to establish an exception to the offense of obstructing government operations for a person making a video or audio recording or photograph of a law enforcement officer while the officer is in the performance of duties in a public place or under circumstances in which the officer has no reasonable expectation of privacy; provided that the officer may take reasonable action to maintain safety and control, secure crime scenes and accident sites, protect the integrity and confidentiality of investigations, and protect the public safety and order.\u00a0 The legislature found that with the popularity and widespread use of smart phones with video or audio recording and photographing capabilities, recordings and photos of law enforcement officers who are exercising their duties have been used as evidence in police conduct matters or widely disseminated via social media.\u00a0 However, such recordings and photographs may be seen as obstructing government operations.\u00a0 Act 164 established an exception under certain circumstances to enable a person to record or photograph a law enforcement officer exercising the officer's duties without violating the law.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2525, Conference Committee Report No. 129-16.\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7710-1010 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 Prop.
