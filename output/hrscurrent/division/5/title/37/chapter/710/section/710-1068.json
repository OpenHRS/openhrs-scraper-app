[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nRevision Note\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 In paragraphs (1) and (2), \"or\" deleted pursuant to \u00a723G-15.\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7710-1068\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 This section precludes certain defenses which might be raised by a defendant in a prosecution under a section in this part.\u00a0 The same result would probably be reached by court interpretation; however, to avoid confusion this section deals with these defenses specifically.\n\u00a0 Subsection (1) precludes a defense based on the incompetency of a defendant to give certain testimony.\u00a0 This subsection does not apply where the incompetency is based on a complete lack of penal responsibility (i.e., the defenses to penal liability provided by chapter 704.).\n\u00a0 Subsection (2) precludes a defense based on the inadmissibility, under the rules of evidence, of the false testimony.\u00a0 For example, a defendant in a perjury prosecution could not claim that, because a correct application of the rules of evidence would have precluded the defendant's testimony as being hearsay or irrelevant, the defendant is not guilty of the falsification offense.\u00a0 This subsection follows logically from the definition of \"materially false statement\" in \u00a7710-1000(9), which separates \"materiality\" from \"admissibility.\"\u00a0 \"These provisions are based on the same basic principle that once a person's testimony is admitted he cannot excuse his perjury on the ground that the testimony was subject to objection and should have been excluded in the first instance.\"[1]\n\u00a0 Subsection (3) states the general rule that irregularities in the administration of the oath are not a defense to falsification under oath.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Section[s 710-1060, 1061, and 1062] deal with statements under oath or affirmation.\u00a0 The guiding principle is that when the community commands or authorizes certain statements to be made with special formality or on notice of special sanction, the seriousness of the demand for honesty is sufficiently evident to warrant application of criminal sanctions.\u00a0 Oath, affirmation for those with religious or other scruples against oaths, or--under Section [710-1000(10)]--notice that the state means to apply criminal penalties to misstatements, should suffice.\u00a0 Technical irregularities in the administration of the oath are of no concern to the defendant, as we have expressly provided in subsection (3).[2]\n\u00a0\u00a0Subsection (4) \"is designed to deal with a situation where the oath was taken as required by law, but was administered by a person who lacked authority to do so,\"[3] such as a notary whose commission expired.\u00a0 The Code precludes a defense to falsification under such circumstances.\n\u00a0 Previous Hawaii statutory law was silent on the subjects covered in this section.\u00a0 The case law has not dealt with the subjects covered by subsections (1) and (2), is in accord with subsection (3),[4] and is, in an old case, contrary to subsection (4).[5]\u00a0 The Code, in this section, represents an addition to the law and a slight modification of an old decision.\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7710-1068 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 Prop.
