[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; gen ch 1993; am L 2006, c 230, \u00a747]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7710-1040\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 In most cases, bribery subverts the efficient functioning of the government to the benefit of a private individual, or a limited class of individuals.\u00a0 Efficiency is undermined because those choices and decisions which are the job of public servants cease to be made solely on the basis of merit, and hence the chance that the alternative most beneficial to the functioning of the government, or to the people collectively, is decreased.\u00a0 The pervasive and far-reaching nature of this offense against public administration warrants the class C felony sanction.\n\u00a0 Moreover, both parties to bribery are obviously to be considered culpable, one no less than the other.\u00a0 The victim of this offense is usually the public in general, although in particular instances (particularly competitive bid and judicial or quasi-judicial situations) individuals may suffer more directly.\u00a0 Subsection (1)(a) covers the offeror of the bribe, while subsection (1)(b) covers the offeree.\n\u00a0 The defense provided for in subsection (2) is intended to allow the actor who commits bribery as a result of extortion or coercion to have the opportunity to raise these facts as a defense.\u00a0 As with all defenses in this Code which are not made affirmative, once the issue is raised, the prosecution must negate it beyond a reasonable doubt.\u00a0 It is questionable whether the sections on duress (\u00a7702-231) or choice of evils (\u00a7703-302) adequately cover this situation.\u00a0 Therefore, the defense is specifically provided for by this subsection.\n\u00a0 Previous Hawaii law recognized bribery as a criminal offense, but treated bribe giving as a lesser offense than bribe receiving,[1] which carried approximately the same penalty as that provided by the Code.\u00a0 The Code equalizes the penalties.\u00a0 In defining the offense the Code requires that the actor have the intent to influence or the intent to be influenced.\u00a0 Previous law required that, in case of bribery receiving, the actor act \"corruptly\" and with an \"understanding.\"\u00a0 Under the Code, intent is the relevant state of mind.\u00a0 The Code requires that the actor solicit, accept, or agree to accept the pecuniary benefit with intent that the actor will thereby be influenced.\u00a0 As in the inchoate offense of conspiracy, the Code takes the unilateral approach to penal liability:\u00a0 the offer may be feigned, or made innocently, but if the receiver intended to be influenced thereby liability attaches, notwithstanding an absence of an agreement or understanding.\n\u00a0\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON \u00a7710-1040\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Act 230, Session Laws 2006, amended bribery from a class C to a class B felony, and provided that a person convicted of bribery shall not be eligible for a deferred acceptance of guilty plea or nolo contendere plea under chapter 853.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Plaintiffs failed to establish genuine issue of fact whether five million dollar gift to city and county of Honolulu was a bribe; plaintiffs raised genuine issue of fact whether campaign contributions were bribes.\u00a0 906 F. Supp. 1377 (1995).\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7710-1040 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 Compare H.R.S. \u00a7725-1 with H.R.S. \u00a7725-2."
