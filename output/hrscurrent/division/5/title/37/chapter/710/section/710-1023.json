[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; gen ch 1993; am L 1999, c 23, \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 As suspect classification or fundamental right was not involved, and based upon dissimilar statutory treatment generally accorded to possession of marijuana as opposed to alcohol, where there was a rational basis for dissimilar punishment, \u00a7710-1022 did not violate defendant's equal protection right because it imposed a more severe penalty for marijuana possession than for alcohol possession under this section.\u00a0 92 H. 217 (App.), 990 P.2d 115 (1999).\n\u00a0\u00a0Subsection (1)(b) (1993) is a lesser included offense of \u00a7710-1022(1)(b).\u00a0 92 H. 217 (App.), 990 P.2d 115 (1999).\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7\u00a7710-1022 AND 710-1023\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 These sections penalize the introduction into correctional or detention facilities of materials likely to be used to effectuate escape or otherwise contravene prison rules.\u00a0 Where the materials involved are intrinsically dangerous, to the actor or others, the offense is made a class B felony.\u00a0 Otherwise, it is a class C felony.\u00a0 It is clear that the peculiar population in correctional and detention facilities warrants the reinforcement of regulatory measures by criminal penalties.\n\u00a0 The definition of \"unapproved dangerous instrument\" is intended to ensure that it is not criminal \"for a prisoner to have articles of potential danger when they are made available to him by prison authorities, e.g., in connection with tasks assigned to the prisoner.\"[1]\n\u00a0 The definition of \"unapproved drug\" is intended to allow prison authorities to regulate the use of drugs by prisoners under their control.\u00a0 References to \"narcotic drugs\" or \"dangerous drugs\" would make the regulatory power of prison authorities depend on the statutory definition of those terms; a result which is undesirable.\u00a0 The power of prison authorities ought not to depend on the ability of the legislature to continually enact amendments which reflect the current drug market.\u00a0 Furthermore, definitions of those terms for purposes of drug abuse offenses would not necessarily serve the needs of prison population control.\n\u00a0 Previous Hawaii law made it unlawful for one to bring into or to have possession of \"any alcohol, harmful drug, narcotic drug in any amount, or firearm within or on the grounds of\" any detention facility, \"unless in the course of his duty or profession, without the permission of the superintendent\" in charge of the facility.[2]\u00a0 This former offense corresponds roughly to promoting contraband in the first degree in its coverage and penalty.\u00a0 The Code removes alcohol from the first degree offense, but otherwise expands the offense by including \"dangerous instruments,\" not just \"firearms.\"\u00a0 For example, crowbars and knives, as well as pistols, would be covered.\u00a0 Moreover, the statutory definition of \"harmful drug\" was \"specific\" in stating the types of drugs regarded as \"harmful.\"\u00a0 The Code makes the definition \"procedural\" and requires the prior approval of the supervisor of the facility.\u00a0 The residual second degree offense is an addition to the existing law.\n\u00a0\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON \u00a7\u00a7710-1022 AND 710-1023\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 The Proposed Draft had limited the offense of promoting prison contraband to detention facilities.\u00a0 When the legislature adopted the Code, it added correctional facilities to clarify that the offenses apply to diagnostic and rehabilitation programs as well as detention facilities.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 2 (1972).\u00a0 The legislature also raised the penalties to class B felony and class C felony, instead of class C felony and petty misdemeanor, as recommended by the Proposed Draft.\n\u00a0\u00a0Act 99, Session Laws 1976, amended \u00a7710-1022 to provide more workable definitions for materials prohibited from introduction into correctional and detention facilities.\u00a0 The term \"unapproved dangerous instrument or unapproved drug\" was replaced by \"dangerous instrument or drug\" and the meanings of \"dangerous instrument\" and \"drug\" were tied to the meanings set forth in \u00a7707-700(4) and \u00a7712-1240(1) to (3) and (5) to (7).\n\u00a0 Act 23, Session Laws 1999, amended \u00a7710-1023 by clarifying the definition of contraband as used for the offense of promoting prison contraband in the second degree.\u00a0 The legislature found that \u00a7710-1022 (relating to the offense of promoting prison contraband in the first degree) deals exclusively with dangerous instruments and drugs.\u00a0 Section 710-1023 (relating to the offense of promoting prison contraband in the second degree) also includes dangerous instruments and drugs within the definition of \"contraband.\"\u00a0 The term \"contraband\" as used in \u00a7710-1023 includes any article or thing which the inmate is prohibited by law to possess.\u00a0 By definition, this would include dangerous instruments or drugs which are already prohibited in \u00a7710-1022.\u00a0 As a result, the prohibitions in \u00a7\u00a7710-1022 and 710-1023 overlap.\u00a0 Under a current Hawaii supreme court ruling, if two degrees of an offense overlap, the offender must be charged with the lesser offense.\u00a0 As a result, \u00a7710-1022, which carries the higher class B felony penalty, is currently ineffectual and cannot be utilized by prosecutors.\u00a0 The legislature found that the Act clarified the ambiguity in the law and gave effect to the original legislative intent of the two provisions.\u00a0 House Standing Committee Report No. 432, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1388.\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7\u00a7710-1022 And 710-1023 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 M.P.C., Tentative Draft No. 8, comments at 137 (1958).\n\u00a0\n2.\u00a0 H.R.S. \u00a7353-49."
