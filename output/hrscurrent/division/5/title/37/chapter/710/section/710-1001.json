[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; am L 1989, c 261, \u00a721]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7710-1001\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 This section is derived from the previous law on the forfeiture of bribery money.[1]\u00a0 Since this chapter deals with additional kindred offenses, e.g., compounding, giving and receiving unlawful compensation, giving and receiving improper gifts, unlawful assistance of a private interest, and obtaining unlawful assistance of a public servant, the forfeiture is expressed in general terms to cover all sections in which property is offered, conferred, agreed to be conferred, or accepted as a benefit, pecuniary benefit, or compensation in the commission of an offense defined in this chapter.\u00a0 The mere solicitation or agreement to accept property would not, of course, work a forfeiture.\n\u00a0 The forfeiture is specifically made subject to the requirements of \u00a7701-119 which embodies a single procedure for the establishment of all forfeitures declared by the Penal Code.\u00a0 The procedure provides, as did the previous law,[2] for the protection of innocent owners of property which is involved in the commission of an offense.\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7710-1001 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 H.R.S. \u00a7725-8.\n\u00a0\n2.\u00a0 See id. \u00a7\u00a7725-8 to 725-11."
