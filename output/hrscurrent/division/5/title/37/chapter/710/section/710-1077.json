Barnett (1964),[7] Cheff v. Schnackenburg (1966),[8] Bloom v. Illinois (1968),[9] and Dyke v. Taylor Implement Mfg. Co. (1968)[10] the Court has gradually, and in increments, adopted the position that:\u00a0 (1) the Constitution's criminal jury trial provisions apply to serious offenses and not to petty offenses;[11] (2) criminal contempt \"is a crime in every fundamental respect\" and, for purposes of the constitutional guarantees to trial by jury in criminal cases, it will be treated the same as other criminal offenses;[12] and (3) where the criminal contempt constitutes a serious offense, the Constitution guarantees the right to trial by jury, where the criminal contempt constitutes a petty offense, it does not.[13]\n\u00a0 The Court has distinguished the severity of the penalty authorized or imposed from the seriousness of the offense committed.[14]\u00a0 However, this appears to be a distinction without a difference, because a majority of the Court appear to accept as the best, if not the only, evidence of the seriousness of the offense the penalty authorized or imposed.[15]\u00a0 Although \"the exact location of the line between petty offenses and serious crimes\" is not settled,[16] a majority of the Court appear to accept the position that where the maximum term of imprisonment may not exceed six months a jury trial is not guaranteed by the Federal Constitution in criminal contempt cases.[17]\n\u00a0 Justices Black and Douglas have taken the position that a defendant charged with criminal contempt is entitled, under the Federal Constitution, to a trial by jury.[18]\u00a0 Whether this position results from their characterization of criminal contempt as a serious crime, or from the belief that any imprisonment is a severe penalty which cannot be imposed without trial by jury, is not clear.[19]\n\u00a0 The procedural right to trial by jury in cases of criminal contempt, where \"severe\" punishment is authorized and the offense therefore regarded as \"serious,\" which the Supreme Court has imposed on the states as a matter of constitutional law, has long been recognized by statute in Hawaii.[20]\u00a0 Previous Hawaii law limited the punishment which may be imposed if the Court proceeded summarily without a jury.[21]\n\u00a0 Section 710-1077 attempts to preserve as much of the framework of the previous chapter on contempts[22] as is possible, and at the same time, to clarify and, in some instances, expand the statutory law.\n\u00a0 Subsection (1) spells out more clearly than the previous code the types of conduct regarded as contumacious.\u00a0 Subsections (1)(a), (1)(b), (1)(g), and (1)(h) are clarifications of former law.\u00a0 Each subsection states specifically the mental culpability required for conviction.\u00a0 Contempt in open court under subsection (1)(a) may be committed recklessly; however, under subsection (1)(b) [breach of the peace], (1)(g) [disobedience or resistance to process, injunction, or mandate], and (1)(h) [refusal to be qualified as a witness or answer proper interrogatory] the actor must act intentionally.\n\u00a0 Subsection (1)(d) limits contempt by publication to one who \"knowingly publishes a false report of a court's proceedings.\"\u00a0 The Code eliminates language contained in the previous codification which could be interpreted to penalize as contemptuous constitutionally protected publications.[23]\n\u00a0 Subsections (1)(c) [violation of duty or order by officer of court], (1)(e) [unauthorized practice before a court], (1)(f) [recording deliberation of a jury], and (1)(i) [failure of juror to attend trial or official proceeding] are additions to statutory law.\u00a0 Although similar types of behavior have been held to constitute criminal contempt under case law development,[24] the Code proposes codification of conduct regarded as contempt of court.\u00a0 The policy against common-law crimes also weighs heavily against the unrestrained common-law development of loose statutory standards.\n\u00a0 Subsection (2) makes the offense a misdemeanor; a slight reduction in the two years' imprisonment previously authorized.[25]\u00a0 As in the case of all misdemeanors the offense is triable as a criminal offense, i.e., by a jury unless jury trial is waived.\n\u00a0 Subsection (3) preserves the court's power to dispose of criminal contempts without a jury trial; however, in such cases, the offense must be treated as a petty misdemeanor.\u00a0 The Code makes no distinction, as does the prior law,[26] in the summary punishment which may be imposed by State Supreme, Circuit, and District Courts.\u00a0 The Code's lowest grade of criminal offense, petty misdemeanor, seems easily within the Supreme Court's concept of \"petty offense.\"\u00a0 Disposition of an offense under subsection (3) would not, therefore, violate the defendant's constitutional right to trial by jury.\u00a0 Moreover, the division of subsection (3) into two parts provides due process in another respect.\u00a0 Subsection (3)(b) assures that where the contempt is not direct, i.e., not in the immediate view and presence of the court, nor under such circumstances that the court has knowledge of all the facts constituting the offense, the defendant must be charged, and, if tried, proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\u00a0 A majority of the United States Supreme Court has rejected, repeatedly, the position taken by Black and Douglas, JJ., in their dissents in Barnett, Cheff, and Dyke, that a jury trial is guaranteed by the Federal Constitution in all criminal contempt cases.\u00a0 We have considered implementing by statute this policy in favor of jury trials.\u00a0 However, it seems to us that, on the balance, the value in permitting the court to proceed without a jury, in cases where the offense is treated as a petty misdemeanor, outweighs the value of enlarging the defendant's right to jury trial.\u00a0 A contrary decision would force the court, in some instances, to be a witness in its own behalf--a status it would be ill-suited and loath to assume.\n\u00a0 Subsection (4) provides that contempts which constitute both contempt and another offense do not relieve the defendant of liability for the other offense merely because its commission was contemptuous of the court.\u00a0 For example, if a person were to cause disorder in a courtroom, during the course of proceedings, by assaulting another person, the person would be guilty of contempt.\u00a0 The person would also be guilty of an assault.\u00a0 The fact that the court imposed summary punishment for the contempt, or the fact that the person was put in jeopardy for the misdemeanor offense of criminal contempt of court, would not allow the defendant to plead double jeopardy to a charge of assault based on the same conduct.\u00a0 Any danger presented by the possibility of multiplicity of convictions is obviated somewhat by the limitation in chapter 706 against ordering that sentences be served consecutively.\n\u00a0 Subsection (5) is a concise restatement of former law,[27] with the exception that it eliminates the restriction against district courts trying cases of constructive contempt.\n\u00a0 Subsection (6) explicitly preserves the court's power to deal with cases of civil contempt and is otherwise a restatement of prior law.[28]\n\u00a0\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON \u00a7710-1077\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Act 136, Session Laws 1973, amended subsection (5) by amending the last sentence of the first paragraph and by adding the second paragraph.\u00a0 Prior to amendment, the last sentence of the first paragraph read:\u00a0 \"A conviction under subsection (3)(a) shall not be subject to review by direct appeal.\"\n\u00a0 Act 181, Session Laws 1979, amended subsection (1) and added subsection (7) as part of an effort to provide a remedy to abate as nuisances, certain offenses against public health and morals.\n\u00a0 Act 157, Session Laws 2008, amended subsection (6) to provide that when a court of competent jurisdiction issues an order compelling a parent to furnish the parent's child with support, proof that the order was made, filed, and served on the parent or that the parent was present in court at the time the order was pronounced, and that the parent did not comply with the order, shall constitute prima facie evidence of a civil contempt of court.\u00a0 Act 157 clarified that if an order of civil contempt based on prima facie evidence imposes immediate imprisonment, the order shall set forth the conditions that must be met for release from imprisonment.\u00a0 The Act also clarified that civil contempt of court may be established by means other than by prima facie evidence.\u00a0 Act 157 facilitated the proof of civil contempt of court in proceedings involving enforcement of a court order compelling a parent to pay child support, medical support, or other remedial care for the parent's child.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 21-08, Senate Standing Committee Report No.

Illinois, supra at 211, the Court said:\u00a0 \"Under the rule in Cheff, when the legislature has not expressed a judgment as to the seriousness of an offense by fixing a maximum penalty which may be imposed, we are to look to the penalty actually imposed as the best evidence of the seriousness of the offense.\u00a0 See, ante, p. 503, n. 35.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\u00a0\n16. Duncan v. Louisiana, supra at 161.\n\u00a0\n17. See, e.g., Cheff v. Schnackenburg, see note 8 supra, which, however, set the maximum at six months not on the basis of constitutional principles, but on the basis of the Court's supervisory powers, and Dyke v. Taylor Implement Mfg. Co., see note 10 supra, which upheld a conviction for criminal contempt, notwithstanding the fact that the defendant was denied trial by jury, where the punishment was limited by statute to ten days' imprisonment plus fine.\n\u00a0\n18. Green v. United States, 365 U.S. 165, 193 (1958) (dissenting opinion); United States v. Barnett, supra at 724, (dissenting opinion); Cheff v. Schnackenburg, supra at 384 (dissenting opinion); Dyke v. Taylor Implement Mfg. Co., supra at 223 (dissenting opinion).\n\u00a0\n19. Compare Barnett, supra at 727 (\"[I]f the present defendants committed the acts with which they are charged, their crimes cannot be classified as 'petty,' but are grave indeed.\"), and Cheff, supra at 387 (\"[T]he determination of whether the offense is 'petty' also requires an analysis of the nature of the offense itself; even though short sentences are fixed for a particular offense a jury trial will be constitutionally required if the offense is of a serious character.\"), with Dyke, supra at 223 (\"I am loath to hold whippings or six months' punishment 'as petty.'\u00a0 And here, where the offense is punishable by a $50 fine and 10 days in jail behind bars, I feel the same way.\u00a0 Even though there be some offenses that are 'petty,' I would not hold that this offense falls in that category.\")\n\u00a0\n20. H.R.S. \u00a7729-1 (\"Whoever, after trial by jury, is adjudged guilty of contempt of any court...shall be fined not more than $500 or imprisoned not more than two years....\").\n\u00a0\n21. Id.\n\u00a0\n22. H.R.S. chapter 729.\n\u00a0\n23. See H.R.S. \u00a7729-1, which provides inter alia that one commits contempt \"by publishing animadversions on the evidence or proceedings in a pending trial tending to prejudice the public respecting the same, and to obstruct and prevent the administration of justice; or by knowingly publishing an unfair report of the proceedings of a court, or malicious invectives against a court or jury tending to bring the court or jury, or the administration of justice[,] into ridicule, contempt, discredit or odium....\"\n\u00a0\n24. See Perkins, supra at 461.\n\u00a0\n25. H.R.S. \u00a7729-1.\n\u00a0\n26. Id.\n\u00a0\n27. Id. \u00a7729-5.\n\u00a0\n28. Id. \u00a7729-2."
