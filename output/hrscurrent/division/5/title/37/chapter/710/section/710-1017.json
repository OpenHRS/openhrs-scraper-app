or\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (d)\u00a0 Knowing the person lacks the authority to do so:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (i)\u00a0 The person intentionally destroys, mutilates, conceals, removes, or otherwise impairs the availability of any government records;

am L 1991, c 145, \u00a72; gen ch 1993; am L 2014, c 33, \u00a75]\n\u00a0\nRevision Note\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 In subsection (1)(a) and (b), \"or\" deleted pursuant to \u00a723G-15.\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7710-1017\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 This section is intended to penalize conduct which undermines confidence in the accuracy of public records.\u00a0 The accuracy of public records is essential to efficient public administration and, beyond the immediate context of public administration, the government has an interest in protecting public confidence in its records.\n\u00a0 This section does not require that the misuse of the public record be with intent to defraud another, i.e., to injure an interest which has value, as do the sections on forgery.\u00a0 Nor does this section require that the information made part of the public record, or offered for recordation, registration, or filing, be under oath or sworn to, as do the sections on perjury and related offenses.\u00a0 Those offenses, however, do complement the offense of tampering with public records, but they deal directly, and in a more precise context, with the aggravated circumstances presented.\n\u00a0 This section is also addressed to the problem of access to public records.\u00a0 Obviously, acts of destruction and concealment impair the efficiency of public administration.\u00a0 Subsection (1)(d)(i) is intended primarily to cover acts of destruction, concealment, or impairment by individuals vis-a-vis the government, whereas subsection (1)(d)(ii) is intended primarily to cover the situation where a public servant refuses to surrender records to another public servant when the public servant has the duty to do so.\u00a0 Both clauses of this subsection are, however, worded broadly in order to cover acts of destruction, concealment, or retention outside their areas of immediate concern.\n\u00a0 Subsection (2) is intended to be inclusive and to cover not only records traditionally considered \"public\" but also information kept for the benefit of the government, such as medical prescription records.\n\u00a0 Previous Hawaii law on tampering with public records is similar to the code,[1] however the Code covers acts of tampering not covered under prior law, clarifies the acts that are covered, and dispenses with the former, archaic requirement of \"malice\" as it relates to this offense.\n\u00a0\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON \u00a7710-1017\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Act 33, Session Laws 2014, amended this section to apply to electronic statements, documents, or records.\u00a0 The legislature found that many government and business records are kept in electronic form.\u00a0 However, the current law prohibited only the alteration of records kept in written form.\u00a0 In 2000, Hawaii adopted the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, chapter 489E, to recognize the need to establish the legal validity of electronic records, signatures, and contracts.\u00a0 Act 33 protected consumers by making relevant criminal offenses also applicable to electronic statements, documents, or records.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3330, House Standing Committee Report No. 260-14.\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7710-1017 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 H.R.S. \u00a7753-3."
