[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; gen ch 1993]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7710-1013\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 The harm in allowing the reporting or prosecution of any offense to be \"bought off\" need hardly be developed at length.\u00a0 The very functioning of any effective system for penalizing criminal behavior depends upon the unhampered reporting and prosecution of offenses.\u00a0 The traditional question is whether the offense of \"compounding\" shall apply to one who receives no pecuniary benefit, but nonetheless refrains from reporting an offense.\u00a0 When the offense was a felony, the common law recognized the crime of misprision of a felony, even if no pecuniary benefit was conferred.\u00a0 Most jurisdictions which have codified their penal law have rejected the crime of misprision,[1] as have most modern attempts at penal law revision.[2]\n\u00a0 Subsection (2) excludes cases where the consideration accepted is believed to be due as restitution or indemnification, and it does not require judicial approval.\u00a0 The commentary to the Model Penal Code, from which this section is derived, states the reason for the exception as follows:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Our society does not, in general, impose penal sanctions to compel persons to inform authorities of crime.\u00a0 A person who refrains from reporting a crime of which he was the victim, because his loss has been made good, is no more derelict in his social duty than one who, out of indifference or friendship to the offender, fails to report a known offense.\u00a0 The threat of prosecution for compounding is, in any event, ineffective to promote reporting of offenses by victims who are willing to \"settle\" with the offender, since compounding laws can easily be evaded by accepting restitution or indemnification without explicit \"agreement\" to drop prosecution.\u00a0 Finally, compounding laws impugn the widespread practice of prosecutors, who are frequently content to drop prosecution when restitution has been made by the offender.[3]\n\u00a0 Previous Hawaii law was in accord with the great majority of jurisdictions in rejecting the offense of misprision of a felony.\u00a0 The law penalized compounding of an offense carrying a life sentence with roughly the same dispositions as the Code makes available for any case of compounding.[4]\u00a0 When the compounding was of a lesser offense, the offense was a misdemeanor.[5]\u00a0 The Code authorizes a uniform and, therefore, in some cases, more severe penalty than that authorized by present law.\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7710-1013 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 M.P.C., Tentative Draft No. 9, comments at 207 (1959).\n\u00a0\n2.\u00a0 M.P.C. \u00a7242.5; N.Y.R.P.L. \u00a7215.45; Prop.
