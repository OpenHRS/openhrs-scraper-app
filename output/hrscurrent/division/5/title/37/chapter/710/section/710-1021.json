[L 1972, c 9, pt of 1; gen ch 1993]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Defense of necessity under \u00a7703-302 is available in escape situations.\u00a0 58 H. 252, 566 P.2d 1378 (1977).\n\u00a0 Minor failing to return to detention facility after furlough commits escape.\u00a0 59 H. 456, 583 P.2d 337 (1978).\n\u00a0 Sufficiency of indictment.\u00a0 59 H. 549, 584 P.2d 117 (1978).\n\u00a0 Arrest is complete and defendant is in \"custody\" when defendant has submitted to police and process of taking defendant to police station or to a judge has commenced.\u00a0 62 H. 99, 612 P.2d 102 (1980).\n\u00a0 Although not handcuffed, defendant had been placed under arrest and was therefore in custody for purposes of escape statute.\u00a0 72 H. 360, 817 P.2d 1060 (1991).\n\u00a0 District court erred in holding that defendant's conviction for second degree escape from custody under this section was\u00a0 a \"crime of violence\" for purposes of U.S. Sentencing Guideline \u00a74B1.1(a).\u00a0 782 F.3d 510 (2015).\n\u00a0 There was no support for the government's argument that \u00a7710-1000(3) [defining \"custody\"] sets forth \"elements\" that the prosecution must prove in order to sustain a conviction under this section; none of the modes of custody set forth in \u00a7710-1000(3) is an element of the crime of escape from custody.\u00a0 782 F.3d 510 (2015).\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7\u00a7710-1020 AND 710-1021\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 The basic offense of escape is punished by the Code as a class C felony.\u00a0 When the aggravating circumstances of force or violence are present, the grade of the offense is increased to a class B felony.\n\u00a0 Escape is a fairly serious offense not only because of the potential danger to guards and bystanders incident to the nature of the activity but because it undermines the effectiveness of the system of criminal correction and punishment.\u00a0 From the administrative point of view, there are the disruptions of prison routine and the expense of recapture to consider as additional social evils.\u00a0 Moreover, when a question is raised concerning the legality of the detention, it is desirable to encourage reliance on legal processes, rather than self-help, to terminate any unjustified detention.\u00a0 In the absence of force or violence, the above social dangers and administrative inconvenience, alone, justify the class C felony sanction.\n\u00a0 Previous Hawaii law graded escape on the basis of the crime for which the actor was originally in custody.[1]\u00a0 There are two objections to this approach.\u00a0 First, where the actor has been lawfully imprisoned as a sanction for a crime which the actor has committed, the danger presented by the actor's escape is sui generis and has nothing to do with the offense for which the actor was committed.\u00a0 If a thief and a forger (or an accused thief and an accused forger) were to escape by identical methods, they should be penalized identically, according to the danger presented by their escapes alone.\u00a0 Hence, the Code has rejected this aspect of the former law and grades escapes according to the degree of individual and social danger presented by the actor's conduct.\n\u00a0\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON \u00a7\u00a7710-1020 AND 710-1021\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 The Code as adopted by the legislature in 1972 differs from the Proposed Draft in two areas.\u00a0 First, it includes escapes from \"correctional\" as well as \"detention\" facilities while the Proposed Draft did not.\u00a0 Correctional facilities were included in order to clarify that the offenses apply to existing diagnostic and rehabilitation programs as well as detention facilities.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 2 (1972).\n\u00a0 Second, the Code makes the penalty for escape more severe than the Proposed Draft.\u00a0 Under the Code, escape in the first degree is a class B felony, and escape in the second degree is a class C felony.\u00a0 The Proposed Draft had stated the penalties as class C and misdemeanor, respectively.\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7\u00a7710-1020 And 710-1021 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 H.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7740-1 through 740-3."
