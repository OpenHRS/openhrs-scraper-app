For instance, a court would hardly wish to punish a person for driving at night without the proper lights when the person did so only to summon help to extinguish a fire.\u00a0 The section also provides a justification for more serious acts.\u00a0 For example, it could be used to justify the taking of life to avoid a far greater loss of life.\u00a0 In a classic case, a ship's crew threw certain passengers overboard to lighten an overloaded boat, which would otherwise have sunk with much greater loss of life.\u00a0 This section would justify the action if all of its conditions are met.\n\u00a0 There are numerous reasons supporting the defense of necessity.\u00a0 First, because an individual will probably kill one person, or a few, to avoid the deaths of many others regardless of what the law may say, punishment in such situations would fail to attain its objective of deterrence and would not reflect widely held views about what would be the moral thing to do in such a situation.\u00a0 Second, the life of every individual is assumed to be of equal value, and therefore a numerical preponderance in lives saved over those sacrificed establishes an ethical and legal justification for the otherwise criminal act.\u00a0 Third, there are numerous safeguards built into \u00a7703-302.\u00a0 The danger causing the necessity of choosing between evils must be imminent.\u00a0 Moreover, subsection (2) provides that if the necessity of choosing between harms or evils results from the defendant's recklessness or negligence, the defense is not available in a prosecution of any offense for which recklessness or negligence, as the case may be, suffices for conviction.\n\u00a0 It is no defense under this section that the defendant thought compliance with a statute immoral or unwise; the legislative decision to make particular conduct criminal is to be given great weight.\u00a0 However, this defense is probably in accord with normal legislative intentions, because blind obedience is unlikely to be required in the face of an emergency.\u00a0 The whole matter, with all of its ramifications is to be weighed by the court and the jury in the same manner as in any criminal proceeding.\u00a0 If the defendant's conduct was not necessary, if one evil was not greater than the other, if the defendant exceeded the reasonable bounds of intelligence and morality, the defendant may be convicted for the defendant's conduct notwithstanding the defendant's attempts to justify the defendant's actions.\n\u00a0 Finally, many commentators have had difficulty with the concept of necessity because of the possibility of unforeseeable changes in the perilous situation.\u00a0 For instance, if a number of passengers are thrown overboard from a ship to save a much larger number of persons, there is really no way for the actors to foresee the exact moment when a rescue ship may arrive.\u00a0 There is always the chance that help will arrive in time to make the emergency action unnecessary.\u00a0 Such objections, however, fail to take account of the fact that other defenses which are predicated on a threat to person or property can take account only of the probability of harm.\u00a0 One can never guarantee that the uplifted knife will be plunged into the victim.\u00a0 \"If necessity is not admitted where there is a high degree of probability of disastrous consequences if action is not taken, then it can never be admitted.\"[1]\u00a0 A person faced with such seeming necessity is and will remain in a personal moral quandary because of the person's uncertainty.\u00a0 Our only point is that the threat of criminal punishment is unneeded here.\n\u00a0 There has been no previous statutory provision or case law development in Hawaii on the defense of necessity; this section represents a needed addition to the law.\n\u00a0\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON \u00a7703-302\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 The legislature accepted \u00a7302 of the Proposed Draft without modification.\u00a0 Subsection (2) provides that the defense of justification based on a choice of evils is unavailable where recklessness or negligence suffices to establish culpability when the actor was reckless or negligent in bringing about the situation requiring a choice of harms or evils or in appraising the necessity for the actor's conduct.\u00a0 However, in light of the legislature's introduction of the \"reasonable man standard\" in \u00a7703-300, it appears that negligence on the actor's part in bringing about the situation or in appraising the necessity for the actor's conduct will be sufficient to eliminate the defense in cases which otherwise require intent, knowledge, or recklessness to establish culpability.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Defense of necessity is available to prisoners escaping from prison.\u00a0 58 H. 252, 566 P.2d 1378 (1977).\n\u00a0 The elements of the choice of evils defense are limited to those enumerated by the express language of this section and common law \"considerations\" have not been incorporated into the statutory formulation.\u00a0 90 H. 58, 976 P.2d 372 (1998).\n\u00a0 Choice of evils defense could not apply where defendant had dumped marijuana over lanai railing, thereby eliminating any threat of imminent harm to wife from marijuana use as required under subsection (1)(a); thus, no imminent harm was present to justify defendant's physical abuse of wife.\u00a0 93 H. 63, 996 P.2d 268 (2000).\n\u00a0 The exclusivity of the narrow choice of evils defense set forth in subsection (3) is limited to prosecutions for escape from correctional or detention facilities but not to prosecutions for escape from custody that does not implicate an incarcerational setting; the generic choice of evils defense set forth in subsection (1) is applicable in a prosecution for escape from non-incarcerational custody.\u00a0 96 H. 83, 26 P.3d 572 (2001).\n\u00a0 A dolphin is not \"another\" within the meaning of this section.\u00a0 1 H. App. 19, 613 P.2d 1328 (1980).\n\u00a0 \"Necessity\" or \"choice of evils\" defense discussed.\u00a0 9 H. App. 115, 826 P.2d 884 (1992).\n\u00a0 Harm committed by defendant resisting an order to stop a motor vehicle under \u00a7710-1027(1) by driving away after traffic stop not reasonably designed to actually avoid possible serious physical harm to defendant or passenger under subsection (1)(a).\u00a0 81 H. 147 (App.), 913 P.2d 558 (1996).\n\u00a0 Where case was covered by the defense of defense of others under \u00a7703-305 and, possibly, self-defense under \u00a7703-304, the choice of evils defense under this section did not apply.\u00a0 90 H. 175 (App.), 977 P.2d 183 (1999).\n\u00a0 Defendant was not entitled to a jury instruction on the \"choice of evils\" defense where, pursuant to subsection (1)(b), the Hawaii Penal Code provided a defense (self-defense) dealing with the specific situation involved.\u00a0 91 H. 450 (App.), 984 P.2d 1276 (1999).\n\u00a0 The choice of evils defense under this section and the duress defense under \u00a7702-231 are not, as a matter of statutory law, inconsistent.\u00a0 93 H. 399 (App.), 4 P.3d 533 (2000).\n\u00a0 The more specific choice of evils affirmative defense for prison escape situations under subsection (3) must be construed in conjunction with the more general choice of evils justification defense under subsection (1); thus, any escape on the part of a prisoner must be conduct which a prisoner believes to be necessary to avoid any imminent harm or evil to the prisoner.\u00a0 93 H. 399 (App.), 4 P.3d 533 (2000).\n\u00a0 Unborn children are not included within the definition of \"another\" or \"person\" for purposes of the Hawaii Penal Code; thus, defendant could not justify defendant's physical abuse of girlfriend on grounds that defendant was protecting \"another\" or a third person, specifically, defendant's unborn child.\u00a0 101 H. 3 (App.), 61 P.3d 514 (2002).\n\u00a0 Trial court erred when it gave its choice of evils instruction as evidence did not support a choice of evils instruction; however, there was no reasonable possibility that the error contributed to defendant's conviction.\u00a0 105 H. 319 (App.), 97 P.3d 395 (2004).\n\u00a0 Trial court did not err in denying defendant's request that in addition to the choice of evils defense under this section, jury be instructed on the justification defenses of use of force in the protection of self and others under \u00a7\u00a7703-304 and 703-305; defendant's theory of defense was fully and adequately covered by the choice of evils instruction which the trial court gave and under the circumstances of the case, there was no reasonable possibility that the jury, which rejected defendant's choice of evils defense, might have embraced defenses based on \u00a7\u00a7703-304 and 703-305.\u00a0 114 H. 507 (App.), 164 P.3d 765 (2007).\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7703-302 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 Smith & Hogan, Criminal Law 123 (1965)."
