[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; am L 1986, c 314, \u00a75; gen ch 1993]\n\u00a0\nRevision Note\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Definitions rearranged pursuant to \u00a723G-15.\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7703-300\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 This section provides statutory definitions of terms used repeatedly in this chapter; a discussion of the definitions, when needed or appropriate, is found in the commentary on the section employing the defined terms.\n\u00a0\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON \u00a7703-300\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Chapter 703 provides for a defense based on the legal concept of justification.\u00a0 An extended definition of justification is provided in \u00a7\u00a7703-302 through 309.\u00a0 In most instances, the critical factor in determining whether an actor's conduct is justified is the actor's state of mind or belief respecting facts and circumstances.\u00a0 The legislature changed \u00a7300 of the Proposed Draft by adding the definition of \"believes.\"\u00a0 The definition adopts \"the reasonable man standard with respect to justification for the use of force in self-protection, in the protection of property, and in the protection of others.\u00a0 It is your Committee's finding that the requirement that a person's belief be 'reasonable' for these defenses to be available will provide an objective basis by which to gauge whether or not the use of force was justified.\"\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 2 (1972).\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Subsection (1) cited:\u00a0 9 H.
