[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; ree L 1975, c 163, \u00a73; am L 2001, c 91, \u00a74]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7703-304\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 This section substantially adopts the Model Penal Code rules on justification of the use of force in self-protection.\u00a0 It has been rewritten and reorganized to make it more easily understandable.\n\u00a0 Subsection (1) requires a belief by the actor that the use of protective force is actually necessary, and that unlawful force (defined in \u00a7703-300) is to be used by the assailant.\u00a0 He must believe, further, that immediate use of force is required, although the threatened harm to him need not be \"imminent,\" as the rule was sometimes phrased at common law.\u00a0 It is enough that unlawful force is threatened on the present occasion by his assailant.\u00a0 The actor may make his defensive move without waiting for his assailant to load his gun or to summon reinforcements.\u00a0 Finally, the actor must believe that the particular degree of force used by him is necessary.\u00a0 This formulation is not meant to require a precise equation, but it will limit the defense to situations in which a particular scope and degree of retaliation is believed by the actor to be appropriate to the aggression.\n\u00a0 Subsections (2) and (5) strictly limit the use of deadly force.\u00a0 Under the circumstances specified in subsection (2), the actor may use deadly force if he believes it is necessary to protect himself against death, serious bodily harm, kidnapping, rape, or forcible sodomy.\u00a0 This formulation has two implications:\u00a0 (a) the actor must believe that deadly force is the only viable means of preventing the specified harm, and (b) the actor must believe that one of the specified harms is threatened on the present occasion.\u00a0 \"Deadly force\" is defined in \u00a7703-300.\u00a0 Its use is further restricted by subsection (5).\u00a0 Deadly force may not be used if the actor provoked his assailant's use of force against himself in the same encounter with the purpose of causing death or serious bodily injury.\u00a0 Of course, if he intends only moderate harm and receives a deadly response, the initial aggressor may respond with deadly force.\u00a0 The use of deadly force is also denied when the actor can avoid using it with complete safety by retreating, by surrendering possession of a thing to a person asserting a claim of right to it, or by complying with a demand that he refrain from taking an action which he has no legal duty to take.\u00a0 In any of these cases, the Code may seem to be opting for cowardice.\u00a0 However, it should be the strong principle of any criminal code to prevent death wherever possible.\u00a0 To quote the Model Penal Code commentary,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It rests, of course, upon the view that protection of life has such a high place in a proper scheme of social values that the law cannot permit conduct which places life in jeopardy, when the necessity for doing so can be avoided by the sacrifice of the much smaller value that inheres in standing up to an aggression.[1]\n\u00a0 However, a duty to retreat or take over evasive action is not imposed in two situations.\u00a0 Subsection (5), subparagraph (b)(i), states that the actor is not required to retreat from his dwelling or his place of work unless he was the initial aggressor or unless he is assailed in his place of work by another person whose place of work he knows it to be.\u00a0 We would not normally expect a man to abandon his home to an aggressor and would allow him to stand his ground, although an exception is made, consistent with paragraph (a), if the actor is the initial aggressor.\u00a0 The exception for an attack in a man's place of work is new with the Model Penal Code.\u00a0 The same principles which permit a man to remain in his home would, for example, permit a shopkeeper to defend himself in his place of business without abandoning it to attackers.\u00a0 Subparagraph (b)(ii), of the same subsection, relates to public officials or persons assisting them using force in the performance of duty.\u00a0 It would be against public interest to require a public officer to abandon his duty if he meets resistance.\u00a0 This Code follows the Model Penal Code in extending the justification to all arrests and performances of duty, even if they are technically unlawful.\u00a0 Throughout chapter 703 the rule is that resistance to unlawful arrest is to be made in court rather than physically.\n\u00a0 The Code also specifically requires surrendering possession of a thing when the attacker asserts a claim of right thereto.\u00a0 Where a person offers deadly force unless another surrenders property to him, and claims a right to the property, it is certainly sound policy to save life and litigate the disputed ownership in court.\u00a0 Naturally, however, this rule does not apply in cases of robbery, where the assailant can make no claim of right, and it is the purpose of the Code to permit deadly resistance to robbery if the conditions of subsection (2) are met.\u00a0 Finally, deadly force is impermissible if the actor can avoid using it by complying with a demand that he refrain from any action which he has no duty to take.\u00a0 Again, the policy of saving life seems more insistent than the right of the individual to complete freedom of action.\n\u00a0 Subsection (3) states the generally applicable rule that the actor need not retreat or take any other evasive action before estimating the necessity for the use of force in self-protection.\n\u00a0 Subsection (4) sets general limits on the use of self-protective force.\u00a0 Paragraph (a) follows the Model Penal Code in forbidding any use of force to resist an arrest which the actor knows is being made by a peace officer.\u00a0 Resistance to even an unlawful arrest should be made in court.\u00a0 No valid social policy is served by permitting physical resistance to peace officers who are known as such by the actor.\u00a0 If the law were to permit physical resistance, it would in effect be sanctioning unnecessary injury.\u00a0 However, only force for the purpose of resisting an arrest is proscribed.\u00a0 If the officer threatens to use unlawful force after the arrest, the normal self-protection rules would apply.\u00a0 In other words, the actor may resist a \"peril greater than arrest.\"[2]\u00a0 Paragraph (b) is closely related to \u00a7703-306 (protection of property) which permits the use of force by the occupier or possessor of property to protect it.\u00a0 The actor may not use force to counter that permissible force, when it is directed at him under a claim of right to protect the property, unless he is a public officer or a person assisting him or a person making or assisting in a lawful arrest, or unless he believes that he must use force to protect himself against death or serious bodily harm.\u00a0 A third Model Penal Code exception, dealing with a right of re-entry or recaption, has been omitted.\u00a0 As explained in the commentary to \u00a7703-306, it does not seem wise to deal separately with these matters.\u00a0 This Code treats them under the more general rules relating to protection of property.\n\u00a0 Subsection (6) recognizes that confinement may be used as protective force.\u00a0 Because of the continuing nature of confinement, however, the Code requires the actor to terminate the confinement as soon as he knows he can do so safely.\u00a0 He has no such duty if the person is arrested, simply because the legality of a confinement will then be tested by ordinary judicial processes.\n\u00a0 Previous Hawaii case law required that the defendant's belief be reasonable.[3]\u00a0 Contrary to subsection (3) of the Code, under the Hawaii cases, the defendant must retreat before he uses any force, except in those circumstances where deadly force is the only way serious felonies against persons can be prevented.[4]\u00a0 In the latter situations, it appears that Hawaii case law, like the Code, would require retreat if it could be accomplished with complete safety.[5]\u00a0 To the extent that Hawaii cases demand \"imminent\" danger, in the common law sense,[6] the Code represents a change in the law.\u00a0 Finally, the subsection on confinement is an addition to Hawaii law.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Defendant entitled to instruction on self-defense whenever testimony fairly raises the issue, no matter how weak.\u00a0 59 H. 148, 577 P.2d 793 (1978).\n\u00a0 Defendant is entitled to jury instructions on self-defense where there is any evidence in the record to support jury consideration of the issue.\u00a0 60 H. 504, 591 P.2d 615 (1979).\n\u00a0 In self-defense to charge of homicide, admissibility of evidence of deceased's character for violence and aggression.\u00a0 61 H. 328, 603 P.2d 151 (1979).\n\u00a0 Where trial court conspicuously omitted from its self-defense instruction any reference to the use of \"force\", which was essential to defendant's defense at trial, insofar as defendant expressly disputed whether defendant's use of force constituted \"deadly force\", and instructed jury that, as a matter of law, defendant employed \"deadly force\" against victim because death in fact resulted from defendant's use of force, trial court's instruction was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u00a0 101 H. 377, 69 P.3d 88 (2003).\n\u00a0 Where defendant raised the issue of self-defense, trial court did not err in concluding that prosecution proved that defendant was not acting in self-defense when defendant shot victim.\u00a0 107 H. 469, 115 P.3d 648 (2005).\n\u00a0 Where trial court's jury instruction sufficiently tracked subsection (3) as it informed the jury that the reasonableness of defendant's belief must be viewed from defendant's perspective, appeals court properly determined that the instruction was consistent with the language of this section.\u00a0 118 H. 452, 193 P.3d 368 (2008).\n\u00a0 Jury instruction relating to the defense of the use of force for the protection of other persons pursuant to \u00a7703-305 was erroneous as it improperly included elements relating to the defense of the use of force in self-protection under this section; however, error was harmless because there was no evidence in the record to support a finding that, under the circumstances as a person would reasonably believe them to be, defendant was justified in using force in defense of others.\u00a0 123 H. 205, 231 P.3d 478 (2010).\n\u00a0 Jury instruction explaining the subjective portion of an assessment of petitioner's self-defense claim not misleading where jury was instructed to \"place [themselves] in the shoes of the [petitioner]\" and to assess petitioner's \"subjective belief\"; reading the instructions as a whole, the omission of specific language from State v. Lubong was not necessary to further explain the subjective portion. \u00a0129 H. 206, 297 P.3d 1062 (2013).\n\u00a0 Objective portion of the self-defense jury instruction was not erroneous and misleading where jury instruction substituted the term \"reasonable person\" with \"reasonably prudent person\"; \"reasonably prudent person\" and \"reasonable person\" are interchangeable terms and a reasonable juror would not believe there was a difference between the two terms.\u00a0 129 H. 206, 297 P.3d 1062 (2013).\n\u00a0 The circuit court's self-defense jury instruction was not erroneous; among other things, the jury instruction was based on then-current Hawaii Pattern Jury Instructions-Criminal (HAWJIC) 7.01 with regard to self-defense and petitioner's argument that the instruction should have included language in subsection (3) regarding retreating and other acts, failed.\u00a0 131 H. 463, 319 P.3d 382 (2014).\n\u00a0 Defendant's claim of justification, in defense against prosecution for terroristic threatening, was established regardless of whether or not defendant used deadly force.\u00a0 1 H. App. 167, 616 P.2d 229 (1980).\n\u00a0 Evidence indicated defendant could have retreated safely; attack with baseball bat using sufficient force to break complainant's arm constituted deadly force.\u00a0 2 H. App. 369, 633 P.2d 547 (1981).\n\u00a0 Defendant did not reasonably believe that kicking person on floor was immediately necessary to protect self.\u00a0 2 H. App. 577, 636 P.2d 1365 (1981).\n\u00a0 State failed its burden of introducing substantial evidence disproving defendant's facts or proving facts negativing defendant's self-protection justification defense.\u00a0 9 H. App. 435, 843 P.2d 1389 (1993).\n\u00a0 There was substantial evidence to support trial court's conclusion that a reasonable person would not have believed that it was necessary to use deadly force on the particular occasion.\u00a0 77 H. 429 (App.), 886 P.2d 766 (1994).\n\u00a0 Trial court did not err in denying defendant's request that in addition to the choice of evils defense under \u00a7703-302, jury be instructed on the justification defenses of use of force in the protection of self and others under this section and \u00a7703-305; defendant's theory of defense was fully and adequately covered by the choice of evils instruction which the trial court gave and under the circumstances of the case, there was no reasonable possibility that the jury, which rejected defendant's choice of evils defense, might have embraced defenses based on this section and \u00a7703-305.\u00a0 114 H. 507 (App.), 164 P.3d 765 (2007).\n\u00a0 Prosecution's misstatement of law was not harmless error where (1) prosecution misstated the law concerning self-defense by incorrectly imputing a requirement that defendant must have intended to kill the victim in order for the defense of self-protection to apply, and (2) the trial court did not correct this misstatement by either sustaining defense counsel's objection or curing the misstatement in its jury instructions.\u00a0 Thus, if the jury believed this misstatement, it would have incorrectly concluded that the defense of self-protection was inapplicable since defendant clearly stated that defendant never intended to kill the victim.\u00a0 120 H. 420 (App.), 209 P.3d 1234 (2009).\n\u00a0 Where petitioner was not charged with assault for confining victim to the ground, for which a jury instruction regarding confinement may have been warranted, but rather was charged with murder in the second degree for firing a shotgun at victim resulting in victim's death, and respondent State did not rely at trial on a theory that petitioner unlawfully confined victim, trial court not required, when instructing jury regarding self-defense, to instruct the jury regarding relationship between \"confinement\" and self-defense pursuant to subsection (6).\u00a0 129 H. 206, 297 P.3d 1062 (2013).\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7703-304 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 M.P.C., Tentative Draft No. 8, comments at 24 (1958).\n\u00a0\n2.\u00a0 Id. at 19.\n\u00a0\n3.\u00a0 State v.
