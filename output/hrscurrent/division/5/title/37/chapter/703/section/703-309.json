\u00a723G-15.\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7703-309\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Subsection (1) justifies the use of force against minors by a parent or other person in loco parentis, subject to two limitations:\u00a0 (1) the force must be employed for safeguarding or promoting the welfare of the minor, and (2) it must not be designed to cause or known to create a substantial risk of death, serious bodily injury, disfigurement, extreme pain or mental distress, or gross degradation.\u00a0 Thus the subsection sets a fairly simple and unexceptionable standard; the right of parents to use force to discipline their children is recognized, subject to clear requirements not to cause permanent injury.\n\u00a0 Subsection (2) permits a teacher or other person entrusted with care for a special purpose (e.g., a camp counsellor) to use such force as believed necessary to further that purpose, including the maintenance of discipline, subject to the limitations of subsection (1) relating to death and injury.\u00a0 This subsection recognizes that a teacher will not ordinarily need to have the full scope of parental authority, but will have certain special needs, such as maintenance of class discipline, which are peculiar to the teaching situation.\u00a0 The intent of the Code in allowing this limited justification is not however, to encourage corporal punishment.\n\u00a0 Subsection (3) justifies the use of force by a guardian responsible for the care and supervision of an incompetent person, but only to promote the welfare of the incompetent or to maintain discipline.\u00a0 Force may not, therefore, be used as punishment, as distinct from prevention of misconduct, except for the maintenance of institutional discipline.\u00a0 Force may not cause death, serious bodily injury, or the like, nor may it cause humiliation--a lesser amount of harm than countenanced for children in subsection (1).\n\u00a0 Subsection (4) permits the use of force by a doctor or other therapist to administer a recognized form of treatment which the doctor or other therapist believes to be adapted to promoting the physical or mental health of the patient.\u00a0 Ordinarily such treatment would be administered with consent, but it may be administered without consent in an emergency.\u00a0 Under the wording of the section, if consent is in fact denied by the patient or a person competent to give consent, the use of force would no longer be justified.\n\u00a0\u00a0Subsection (5) justifies force used by a warden or other authorized prison official to enforce prison rules and discipline.\u00a0 The force used must not be in excess of that permitted by statutes relating to prisons, and deadly force may be used only when justified under other sections of this Code.\n\u00a0 Subsection (6) permits the use of force by a person responsible for the safety of a vessel or airplane to prevent interference with its operation or obstruction of the execution of a lawful order (unless the person is erroneous in the person's belief in the lawfulness of the order).\u00a0 Deadly force may be used if justified under this Code.\n\u00a0 Subsection (7) permits force by a person authorized by law to maintain public order in public conveyances and public places.\u00a0 The person may not use force creating a substantial risk of death, bodily injury, or extreme mental distress.\n\u00a0 The section is substantially in accord with preexisting Hawaii law.\u00a0 Hawaii law permits parents \"to chastise [their children] moderately for their good.\"[1]\u00a0 Under prior law, any corporal punishment was permitted if reasonable.[2]\u00a0 To the extent that Hawaii case law suggests that the parents have uncontrolled discretion to discipline their children,[3] the Code represents a change.\u00a0 Similarly, teachers have had authority under Hawaii case and statutory law to use force to maintain discipline in the schools.[4]\u00a0 The punishment must have been reasonable,[5] and the teachers' discretion was considered less extensive than that of parents.[6]\u00a0 Prison officials under prior Hawaii law were permitted to use force to maintain discipline in the prisons;[7] and ship captains had the right to employ force to keep order on their vessels.[8]\u00a0 In all the above situations, the Code states with greater clarity than existing law when, for what purposes, and to what extent force may be used by persons with special responsibility for the care, discipline, or safety of others.\u00a0 Also, subsections (3), (4), and (7) represent additions to Hawaii law.\n\u00a0\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON \u00a7703-309\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Act 210, Session Laws 1992, amended this section to clarify the permitted level of force that a person responsible for the care of a minor, or an incompetent person, may use.\u00a0 In determining whether the level of force used is permitted, a court must consider the age and size of the recipient and whether a reasonable relationship exists between the force used and a legitimate purpose as specified in the statute.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 103.\n\u00a0 Act 94, Session Laws 2001, amended this section to clarify that the use of force upon another person is justified when the actor is a principal or principal's agent, when necessary, during school events or at a departmentally supervised function on or off school property.\u00a0 Current law allowed the use of force by teachers or other persons entrusted with the care or supervision for a special purpose of a minor, if the teacher or person believed the force used was necessary to further the special purpose, including maintenance of reasonable discipline.\u00a0 The legislature found it necessary that school personnel be authorized to take reasonable, appropriate, and expeditious action when confronted with potentially dangerous situations or serious disciplinary situations, on campus and off-campus at authorized school functions.\u00a0 School officials must be allowed to take immediate action to preserve order and discipline without having to wait for the police to arrive.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1400.\n\u00a0 Act 31, Session Laws 2013, amended \u00a7703-309 to clarify the parental discipline defense by: \u00a0(1) establishing a rebuttable presumption that specified types of physical force when used to discipline minors are not justified; and (2) expanding the state of mind element required to establish that the force used is justified by requiring that the force used does not intentionally, knowingly, recklessly, or negligently create a risk of causing substantial bodily injury, disfigurement, extreme pain or mental distress, or neurological damage.\u00a0 Act 31 .\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 322, House Standing Committee Report No. 1223.\n\u00a0\nLaw Journals and Reviews\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Hamilton v. Lethem:\u00a0 The Parental Right to Discipline One's Child Trumps a Child's Right to Grow Up Free from Harm.\u00a0 36 UH L. Rev. 347 (2014).\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Parent did not inflict serious pain when hitting child with belt. \u00a072 H. 241, 813 P.2d 1382 (1991).\n\u00a0 Force used by defendant not reasonably related to protecting minor's welfare where, according to testimony, spanking caused minor to be unable to sit while in school classes.\u00a0 81 H. 5, 911 P.2d 725 (1996).\n\u00a0 Injuries inflicted by defendant designed to cause or known to create a risk of substantial bodily injury, extreme pain or mental distress where, according to testimony, minor was in extreme pain for days and unable to sit without pain for weeks after spanking.\u00a0 81 H. 5, 911 P.2d 725 (1996).\n\u00a0 Trial court's finding that defendant parent's \"slap across the face\" was not \"reasonably proportional\" to child's refusal to come to defendant when repeatedly directed to do so was not supported by substantial evidence.\u00a0 90 H. 85, 976 P.2d 399 (1999).\n\u00a0 Where defendant, a non-custodial parent, was acting within the defendant's court-prescribed unsupervised visitation time, defendant retained, as a \"residual parental right\", within the meaning of \u00a7571-2, the authority to discipline defendant's child with respect to that child's conduct during the visitation period; thus, defendant was a \"parent\" for purposes of paragraph (1).\u00a0 90 H. 85, 976 P.2d 399 (1999).\n\u00a0 Prosecution failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that mother's conduct did not come within the scope of parental discipline as prescribed in paragraph (1) where, considering the totality of the facts and circumstances, the force employed by mother was reasonably proportionate to daughter's defiant behavior towards mother, was reasonably believed to be necessary to discipline daughter, and the force used was \"not designed to cause or known to create substantial bodily injury, disfigurement, extreme pain or mental distress, or neurological damage\".\u00a0 115 H. 149, 166 P.3d 322 (2007).\n\u00a0 Considering the totality of facts and circumstances, the force employed by mother's boyfriend (1) was reasonably proportionate to minor's defiant behavior towards boyfriend, (2) was reasonably believed to be necessary to discipline\u00a0 minor for minor's defiant attitude and demeanor, and the degree of force used was \"not designed to cause or known to create a substantial risk of causing bodily injury\"; thus, boyfriend's discipline was not excessive in light of minor's age, misconduct, and the comparatively mild physical force used, and the prosecution failed to disprove boyfriend's parental discipline defense beyond a reasonable doubt.\u00a0\u00a0 119 H. 468, 199 P.3d 57 (2008).\n\u00a0 Appellate court erred in determining that respondent was precluded from having the jury instructed on the parental discipline defense because the force used against complainant resulted in substantial bodily injury; the plain language of paragraph (1)(b) specifically ties the defense to criminal liability to the nature of the force used as opposed to the result of such use of force.\u00a0 125 H. 78, 253 P.3d 639 (2011).\n\u00a0 Where there was some evidence indicating that under the circumstances, the force used was not designed to cause or known to create a risk of substantial bodily injury, defendant was entitled to have the parental discipline defense instruction given to the jury for it to make that determination.\u00a0 125 H. 78, 253 P.3d 639 (2011).\n\u00a0 Where, with respect to paragraph (1)(a), defendant did adduce some evidence that the force \"was employed with due regard for the age and size of the minor and was reasonably related to the purpose of safeguarding or promoting the welfare of the minor, including the prevention or punishment of the minor's misconduct\", the defendant was entitled to instruction on this defense, no matter how weak, unsatisfactory, or inconclusive the evidence might have appeared to the court; where a defendant asserts the parental discipline defense in a jury trial, it is for the jury to decide whether such a defense has merit.\u00a0 125 H. 78, 253 P.3d 639 (2011).\n\u00a0 Appellate court correctly held that there was sufficient evidence to sustain defendant's harassment conviction under \u00a7711-1106(1)(a) where defendant chose to slap minor in the face and strike minor with a bamboo stick at least five times with enough force to leave red welts visible the next day; based on the totality of circumstances in the case, substantial evidence existed to support the conclusion that the State proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the force defendant employed against minor was without due regard for minor's age and size, thus disproving defendant's parental justification defense under this section.\u00a0 126 H. 494, 273 P.3d 1180 (2012).\n\u00a0 Where parent struck child, evidence insufficient to support finding that force used by parent exceeded protection provided by paragraph (1)(b) (1985).\u00a0 9 H. App. 345, 841 P.2d 1076 (1992).\n\u00a0 Trial court erred when it concluded that \"reasonably related\" standard in paragraph (1)(a) precludes altogether the use of disciplinary force simply because prior non-physical alternatives failed to prevent minor's continuing misconduct.\u00a0 82 H. 373 (App.), 922 P.2d 986 (1996).\n\u00a0 The \"physical harm\" encompassed in the definition of family violence in \u00a7571-2 would not preclude a parent's right to use force to discipline a child as permitted by paragraph (1), and duty to discipline a child under \u00a7577-7(a).\u00a0 88 H. 200 (App.), 965 P.2d 133 (1998).\n\u00a0 The term \"family violence\" in \u00a7571-46(9) (1993) does not extend to the type of physical discipline of a child by his or her parent that is expressly permitted in paragraph (1); the limits on the use of physical force as a disciplinary measure in paragraph (1) adequately served to guide the family court's application of \u00a7571-46(9) (1993) in determining the best interests of the child when awarding custody or visitation.\u00a0 88 H. 200 (App.), 965 P.2d 133 (1998).\n\u00a0 There was substantial evidence adduced to negate the \"parental discipline\" justification defense under paragraph (1) where what uncle levied upon nephew was a wanton beating that (1) was not reasonably related to the purpose of safeguarding or promoting the welfare of the nephew, including the prevention or punishment of the nephew's misconduct, nor reasonably proportional to the misconduct being punished and reasonably believed necessary to protect the welfare of the nephew, and (2) directly or by its common sequelae is \"known to create a risk of substantial bodily injury\".\u00a0 105 H. 394 (App.), 98 P.3d 265 (2004).\n\u00a0 Defendant's conviction of harassment under \u00a7711-1106 reversed where trial court erroneously concluded that father's actions could not be seen as reasonably necessary to protect the welfare of the recipient, and the State failed its burden of disproving beyond a reasonable doubt the justification evidence that was adduced, or proving beyond a reasonable doubt facts negativing the justification defense under this section.\u00a0 106 H. 252 (App.), 103 P.3d 412 (2004).\n\u00a0 Family court addressed father's permissible discipline argument under paragraph (1) and did not err in failing to apply this parental discipline defense when it concluded that even if the defense were available, father's use of force was not reasonably related to safeguarding or promoting minor's welfare.\u00a0 125 H. 330 (App.), 260 P.3d 1148 (2011).\n\u00a0 Although father's punches were forceful enough to cause bruising, they were not forceful enough to rise to the level of viciousness in which the level of attack \"severed any relationship between the use of force and the welfare\" of the complaining witness that \"might be considered reasonable\"; it was at most a \"gray area\" in which some in the community would find that father's extent of punishment was inappropriate; however, such gray areas are not resolved by criminalizing such parental discipline; therefore, there was insufficient evidence to disprove father's parental discipline defense under paragraph (1)(a).\u00a0 125 H. 406 (App.), 263 P.3d 116 (2011).\n\u00a0 Where there was no substantial evidence and nothing in the record to indicate that father's punching son twice on son's left leg was designed to cause or was known to create the risk of causing extreme mental distress, the State did not disprove beyond a reasonable doubt father's parental discipline defense under paragraph (1)(b).\u00a0 125 H. 406 (App.), 263 P.3d 116 (2011).\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7703-309 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 H.R.S. \u00a7577-7.\n\u00a0\n2.\u00a0 Id. \u00a7577-12.\n\u00a0\n3.\u00a0 Territory v.
