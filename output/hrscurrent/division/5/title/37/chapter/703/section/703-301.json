[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7703-301\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 This section does not attempt to define the defense of justification.\u00a0 An extended definition is given in the sections which follow.\u00a0 Subsection (1) merely establishes that justification is a defense.\u00a0 This places the burden of producing some credible evidence of the existence of justification on the defendant.\u00a0 If the defendant produces such evidence, or if it appears as part of the prosecution's case, the defendant is entitled to have the defense considered by the jury.\u00a0 The prosecution, however, must prove beyond a reasonable doubt, facts which negative the defense.\n\u00a0 Subsection (2) preserves civil remedies for conduct which may give rise to a defense of justification.\u00a0 Civil standards of conduct are higher than we propose for criminal liability.\u00a0 For example, unreasonable conduct on the part of the defendant might suffice for civil liability whereas criminal liability will turn on the defendant's own subjective mental state.\u00a0 It therefore seems desirable explicitly to preserve civil remedies.\n\u00a0 Prior Hawaii statutory and case law recognized some of the defenses which the Code unites in this chapter under the defense of justification.\u00a0 Reference to such recognition will be made in the commentary under the sections which follow.\u00a0 There is some language in old Hawaii case law which indicates that the defense of justification is affirmative in nature;[1] to the extent that this language would be followed today, the Code represents a change.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Justification is not an affirmative defense and prosecution has burden of disproving it once evidence of justification has been adduced.\u00a0 60 H. 259, 588 P.2d 438 (1978).\n\u00a0 Defendant's claim of justification, in defense against prosecution for terroristic threatening, was established regardless of whether or not defendant used deadly force.\u00a0 1 H. App. 167, 616 P.2d 229 (1980).\n\u00a0 \"Choice of evils\" defense applies to violations.\u00a0 9 H. App. 115, 826 P.2d 884 (1992).\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7703-301 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 King v. Bridges, 5 Haw. 467, 472 (1885); Provisional Government v. Caecires, 9 Haw. 522, 533 (1894)."
