[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7705-523\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 The problems arising out of possible immunity, irresponsibility, or incapacity of a person to a criminal conspiracy are dealt with essentially in the commentary on \u00a7705-511 (dealing with immunity, irresponsibility, or incapacity of a party to criminal solicitation).\u00a0 This section is intended to resolve these problems should they arise in a conspiracy context.\n\u00a0 This section has no counterpart in previous Hawaii law.\u00a0 Other jurisdictions have held that there can be no conspiracy in such situations because a conspiracy, as an agreement of two or more persons, requires at least two guilty conspirators.[1]\u00a0 In keeping with the unilateral approach to conspiracy of this Code, however, it is evident that the danger of the conspiracy arising from collective joint action remains essentially the same whether or not one of the conspirators cannot be successfully prosecuted.\u00a0 Moreover, one of the principal reasons for imposing penal liability in the area of inchoate crimes, i.e., the unequivocal presence of a strong intent to commit a crime, is present regardless of the co-conspirator's innocence, incapacity, or irresponsibility.[2]\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7705-523 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 Prop. Mich. Rev. Cr. Code, comments at 102.\n\u00a0\n2.\u00a0 Id.; see also commentary on \u00a7705-520."
