[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; gen ch 1993]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7705-524\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Section 705-524 is aimed at affording the defendant constitutional venue protection.\u00a0 The Sixth Amendment to the Federal Constitution provides that in \"all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed.\"\u00a0 However, the use of a conspiracy charge under current, loose definitions of conspiracy dilute this protection.\u00a0 The unilateral approach of the Code, its limited definition and scope of conspiracy, and section 705-524 combine to establish proper venue.\u00a0 As the Model Penal Code commentary points out:\n\u00a0 It is contemplated that the stricter tests of a conspiracy's scope advanced in the Draft will considerably limit the present dilution of the constitutional protection.\u00a0 [Section 705-524] explicitly provides that proper venue for a conspiracy charge will be tested by the defendant's agreement or overt act or an overt act of a person with whom he conspired.\u00a0 It assures that in complex cases involving a number of separate conspiracies, venue as to each conspiracy with which each defendant is charged will not be laid on the basis of an overt act done pursuant to a different conspiracy or by a person with whom he did not conspire.[1]\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7705-524 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 M.P.C., Tentative Draft No. 10, comments at 138-39 (1960)."
