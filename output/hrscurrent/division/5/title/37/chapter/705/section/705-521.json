[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7705-521\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 This section is addressed to the problem of defining the scope of the conspiratorial relationship.\u00a0 Organized crime may involve a network of activity of which the defendant's conduct is but a small part.\u00a0 For example, the narcotics traffic may involve smuggling, possession, and sale of the narcotic.\u00a0 Questions affecting multiple prosecutions, joint prosecution, admissibility of evidence, and the statute of limitations have conventionally turned on the scope of the conspiracy charged.\n\u00a0 The Code divorces procedural and evidentiary problems from the definition or scope of criminal conspiracy.\u00a0 Procedural problems are handled separately in \u00a7705-524 (dealing with venue) and in the rules of court and statutes relating to penal procedure.\n\u00a0 The definition of \u00a7705-520 in effect limits the scope of the conspiracy to those crimes which the defendant intends to promote or facilitate.\u00a0 Section 705-521 limits the scope of the conspiracy \"in term of parties, to those with whom he agreed, except where the same crime that he conspired to commit is, to his knowledge, also the object of a conspiracy between one of his co-conspirators and another person or persons.\"[1]\u00a0 In cases involving a broad scope of criminal operations entailing numerous different offenses, the focus is on whether the defendant knows that the defendant's co-conspirator has conspired with another person to commit the same crime.\u00a0 Focusing separately on each criminal objective, it is possible to conclude that different members of a criminal network are guilty of different conspiracies.\u00a0 Thus, in a narcotics operation, a smuggler, a distributor, and a retailer may all be guilty of conspiring that the retailer possess the narcotics, whereas the retailer may not be guilty of a conspiracy to have the smuggler engage in smuggling.\u00a0 The retailer may have no knowledge of or may be completely indifferent to the source or character of the retailer's supply.\n\u00a0 Agreement under \u00a7\u00a7705-520 and 521 need not be explicit; it can, of course, be inferred from mutual facilitation and purpose.\u00a0 Section 705-521 specifically provides that in cases where there is no direct correspondence or cooperation, the defendant may be guilty of conspiracy with other persons, possibly unidentified, if the defendant knows that the defendant's co-conspirator has conspired with them to commit the same offense.\n\u00a0 The inquiry which the Code requires is more complicated than that allowed under current and past doctrine which, in some statements,[2] has permitted a member of an illegal operation to be guilty of a conspiracy involving all of the operation's criminal objectives no matter how remote from the defendant's individual involvement.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We recognize that the inquiry demanded by the Draft will often be more detailed and sometimes will be more complicated than that called for under looser, current doctrine.\u00a0 We submit that any greater difficulty involved is justified by the need for effective means of limiting a conspirator's criminal liability and preventing the other abuses possible under looser approaches toward the scope of a conspiracy.\u00a0 Further, we submit that the focus upon each individual's culpability with regard to each criminal objective should be more helpful to juries than the broad formulations with which they are often charged today; and that it accords more closely with traditional standards for testing criminal liability.[3]\n\u00a0 Previous Hawaii law made no reference to the scope of conspiracy in terms of the parties involved.\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7705-521 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 M.P.C., Tentative Draft No. 10, comments at 119 (1960).\n\u00a0\n2.\u00a0 See United States v.
