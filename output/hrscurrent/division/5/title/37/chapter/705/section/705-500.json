References\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Definitions of states of mind, see \u00a7702-206.\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7705-500\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 The proscription against criminal attempts is sometimes said to be based on the dangerousness of the actor's conduct.\u00a0 While this rationale would support a result in many cases, in others it would not.\u00a0 A defendant may engage in conduct which itself cannot be said to be dangerous, but which, when measured against the defendant's intent, would indicate that the defendant himself is a dangerous person and the proper subject of the penal law.\u00a0 The Code therefore focuses on the defendant's disposition.\u00a0 Our concern is not with thought or disposition alone; but rather to clarify \"what conduct, when engaged in with a purpose to commit a crime or to advance towards the attainment of a criminal objective, should suffice to constitute a criminal attempt.\"[1]\n\u00a0 The nature of intent in attempt cases.\u00a0 Subsection (1) recognizes penal liability where the defendant's conduct is intentional and consummation of the crime is prevented either by the defendant's erroneous appraisal of attendant (i.e., those specified by the definition of the offense) or other circumstances or by some intervening factor following a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in the commission of the crime. \u00a0It is easy to recognize penal liability in such cases, notwithstanding the absence of a substantive offense, because the defendant's intent--the defendant's conscious object--is commission of a crime.\u00a0 The defendant's disposition toward criminal activity thus established, attempt liability is imposed, under subsection (1)(a), if the defendant's conduct has advanced so far toward the criminal objective as to constitute the crime had the attendant circumstances been as the defendant believed them to be, or, under subsection (1)(b), if the defendant's conduct has advanced so far toward the criminal objective as to constitute a substantial step in a course of conduct intended to reach that objective.\n\u00a0 In subsection (2) liability is imposed on a defendant who has intentionally engaged in conduct which is a substantial step in a course of conduct intended or known to culminate in a prohibited result.\u00a0 Thus, a defendant who intends to destroy a building, and who regards the destruction of its inhabitants as a regrettable by-product, could be convicted of attempted murder (as well as attempted arson)[2] if the defendant intentionally performed a substantial step (e.g., started a fire) which the defendant knew (i.e., was practically certain) would result in death.\u00a0 Attempt liability is provided for a defendant who engages in such conduct because the defendant's manifestation of dangerousness is of the same order as that of the defendant who engaged in the intentional conduct of subsection (1).\n\u00a0 Subsection (2) also covers a relatively infrequent, but nonetheless troublesome, occurrence in attempt cases.\u00a0 A given crime may be so defined that the attendant circumstances may be established by a nonintentional state of mind (i.e., with respect to the attendant circumstances the actor may act knowingly, recklessly, or negligently).\u00a0 If such is the case, and the defendant intentionally engages in conduct planned to culminate in the result, attempt liability should exist if the defendant was otherwise culpable with respect to the attendant circumstances.\u00a0 Suppose, for example, that it is an independent crime to intentionally kill a police officer and that recklessness with respect to the victim's identity as a police officer is sufficient to establish that attendant circumstance.\u00a0 If a defendant attempts to kill a police officer recklessly mistaken as to the intended victim's identity (e.g., the defendant recklessly believes the police officer to be a night security guard), attempt liability ought to result.\u00a0 Subsection (2) so provides.\u00a0 It would hardly make sense to hold that the defendant should be relieved of attempt liability in the situation hypothesized because the defendant did not intend that the victim be a police officer.\u00a0 Furthermore, it would be anomalous to hold that had the defendant succeeded, and the substantive crime been consummated, the defendant would be guilty of the substantive crime but that, upon the failure of the defendant's attempt, the defendant's lack of intent with respect to an attendant circumstance precludes penal liability for the attempt.\n\u00a0 It should be noted that the requirement of intentional conduct, with respect to attempts, limits the application of the attempt section to offenses which can be committed by intentional conduct.\u00a0 For example, if a given offense can be committed by intentional or reckless conduct, reckless conduct which stops short of consummation of the offense is not sufficient to constitute an attempt to commit the offense.\u00a0 To constitute an attempt, the inchoate behavior must be intentional, i.e., purposeful.\u00a0 This principle is illustrated by the following passage from the commentary to Michigan's recent revision:\nThus, where criminal liability rests on the causation of a prohibited result, the actor must have an intent to achieve that result even though violation of the substantive offense may require some lesser mens rea.\u00a0 Reckless driving, for example, does not constitute attempted manslaughter.\u00a0 A person charged with the substantive crime of manslaughter may be liable as a result of... recklessness causing death, but the same recklessness would not be sufficient if the victim did not die and the actor were only charged with attempt; here, the state would have to show an intent to achieve the prohibited end result, death of the victim.\u00a0 In this area, as in others if the substantive crime requires only recklessness, the mens rea requirement for an attempt is substantially higher than that for the substantive crime.[3]\n\u00a0 Substantial step.\u00a0 Subsections (1)(b) and (2) also deal with and resolve another problem which has troubled courts in deciding attempt cases: \u00a0the act or conduct sufficient to impose penal liability.\u00a0 It is an old saw that the penal law does not seek to punish evil thought alone.\u00a0 However, in attempt cases some decision must be made as to what conduct, when engaged in with a criminal intent, will be sufficient for the imposition of criminal liability notwithstanding the defendant's failure to commit a substantive offense.\u00a0 It seems clear that there is no difficulty in holding a defendant penally liable for an attempt when the defendant's conduct would have constituted the crime if the defendant had not been mistaken about the attendant circumstances.\u00a0 This is the easy case resolved by subsection (1)(a).\u00a0 In those cases where the defendant's intentional conduct does not constitute the substantive crime either because of some mistake on the defendant's part unrelated to specified attendant circumstances (e.g., mistake as to the capability of the means used) or because the course of conduct has not proceeded to its final objective, some principle must be articulated to indicate when attempt liability initially obtains.\u00a0 This is a most delicate task.\n\u00a0 Accepting as we do the position of the Model Penal Code that attempt liability is primarily concerned with the dangerous disposition of the actor as manifested by conduct, this Code also follows the Model Penal Code in rejecting any standard based on the proximity of the actor's conduct to the culmination of the crime.[4]\u00a0 Adherence to that standard would require that the dangerousness of the defendant's conduct rather than the dangerousness of the defendant be regarded as the determining factor.\u00a0 The Code follows the Model Penal Code standard in requiring in subsections (1)(a) and (2) that the relevant conduct amount to a \"substantial step in a course of conduct\" planned to culminate in the commission of the crime or intended or known to cause a criminal result.\n\u00a0 Subsection (3) provides that conduct shall not be considered a \"substantial step\" under subsections (1) and (2) unless it is strongly corroborative of the defendant's criminal intent.\u00a0 In excluding acts which are not strongly corroborative, the Code seeks to provide an additional safeguard in the application of the \"substantial step\" standard so that law enforcement agencies and triers of fact will not put equivocal conduct within its ambit.\u00a0 There are, on the other hand, certain types of conduct which, if strongly corroborative of the defendant's criminal intent, could reasonably be held to constitute a \"substantial step\" and should not be held insufficient on this issue as matter of law.\u00a0 These types of conduct are:\u00a0 (a) lying in wait, searching for, or following the contemplated victim of the crime; (b) enticing or seeking to entice the contemplated victim of the crime to go to the place contemplated for its commission; (c) reconnoitering the place contemplated for the commission of the crime; (d) unlawful entry of a structure, vehicle, or enclosure in which it is contemplated that the crime will be committed; (e) possession of materials to be employed in the commission of the crime, which are specially designed for such unlawful use or which can serve no lawful purpose of the actor under the circumstances; (f) possession, collection, or fabrication of materials to be employed in the commission of the crime, at or near the place contemplated for its commission, where such possession, collection, or fabrication serves no lawful purpose of the actor under the circumstances; and (g) soliciting an innocent agent to engage in conduct constituting an element of the crime.[5]\u00a0 Rather than propose codification of these examples, we set them forth in the commentary to aid the court in the interpretation of subsection (3).\n\u00a0 It can, of course, be argued that the Code's formulation leaves an area of imprecision where preciseness is most needed.\u00a0 As in other areas of the Code,[6] the limits of what can be made precise must be recognized.\u00a0 It has been said that the genius of the Model Penal Code, from which this Code is to a great extent derived, is demonstrated by its recognition of the limits of precision in statutory language.[7]\nThe characteristic spirit of the Code's draftmanship inheres in its adoption of the \"Aristotelian axiom\" that \"it is the mark of the educated man to seek precision in each class of things just so far as the nature of the subject admits.\"\u00a0 When precision is possible, the Code is devastatingly precise.\u00a0 When precision is not possible, it is not sought, nor is there any pretense that it has been attempted.[8]\n\u00a0 While substantiality is obviously a matter of degree, it is no more so in attempt cases than it is in recklessness, negligence, or causation problems.\u00a0 In each case the jury or the court (when it is trying the facts) must address itself to the defendant's conduct and determine, with a view to other stated criteria,[9] whether it should be condemned.\n\u00a0 The Code focuses on what is deemed to be the correct function of the act requirement in attempt cases: \u00a0to provide a standard which (a) distinguishes between conduct which is highly equivocal from the external standpoint and that which is not externally equivocal, or only slightly so, and which (b) is oriented toward the actor's disposition or dangerousness rather than toward proximity to consummation of the substantive crime.\u00a0 In looking at the substantiality of the defendant's step in a course of conduct, the Code requires the trier of fact to measure what has already been done by the defendant--not how much more the defendant must do before consummation of the substantive crime is achieved.\u00a0 To this extent, the shift in focus broadens the scope of attempt liability.\n\u00a0 Rejection of defense of impossibility.\u00a0 Focusing as it does on the dangerousness of the actor, rather than on the dangerousness of the actor's conduct, the Code rejects the defense of \"impossibility\" in attempt cases.\u00a0 The Code does not afford a defense to one who intends a criminal course of conduct but who is mistaken as to certain circumstances which make commission of the crime legally or factually impossible.\n\u00a0 Subsection (1) is addressed to the problem of the defendant's mistake as to attendant circumstances (i.e., circumstances specified in the definition of the offense).\u00a0 It makes such mistake immaterial if the crime would have been consummated had the attendant circumstances been as the defendant believed them to be.\u00a0 Thus, for example, a defendant would be guilty of attempt to bribe a juror if the defendant offered a bribe to a person the defendant believed to be a juror notwithstanding the fact that the object of the bribe turned out not to be a juror.\u00a0 A defendant would be guilty of attempted murder if the defendant intentionally shot a corpse or tree stump believing it to be a living person.\u00a0 Of course, the conduct or result must be specified in the definition of an offense; the actor's belief that it is criminal is not sufficient.\u00a0 For example, a person who seeks to give false testimony is not guilty of attempted perjury if the testimony sought to be given is immaterial and would not, if given constitute perjury.[10]\n\u00a0 Subsection (1)(b) is addressed in part to the problem of impossibility.\u00a0 A defendant may be mistaken as to circumstances other than those specified in the definition of an offense and such mistake may render actual commission of the offense impossible.\u00a0 Thus, for example, a defendant may aim and fire a gun at another mistakenly believing that it is loaded or the defendant may set some sort of explosive trap unaware that the fuse is defective and incapable of detonating the charge.\u00a0 Also, the defendant may be mistaken as to attendant circumstances and the defendant may have taken a substantial step toward the defendant's criminal objective, but the defendant's conduct has not advanced far enough to constitute the crime had the attendant circumstances been as the defendant supposed.\u00a0 For example, a defendant may set a fatal trap near a corpse, believing it to be a living person.\u00a0 In such cases, subsection (1)(b) permits liability for the attempt.\u00a0 In the examples stated the defendant believed the means chosen to be sufficient or the attendant circumstances to be present, and the defendant has obviously taken a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in the commission of a crime.\u00a0 There is no reason to preclude liability for the attempt merely because the defendant was mistaken as to some circumstance which made actual commission of the substantive crime impossible.\u00a0 Where the offense is defined in terms of the result of conduct, subsection (2) would also cover the situation.\n\u00a0 Previous Hawaii law.\u00a0 The previous law of attempt, H.R.S. \u00a7702-1 (as compiled prior to this Code) required intent plus some act towards commission, as does the Code.\u00a0 However, there was no requirement that the act be a substantial step in furtherance of the commission.\u00a0 There are apparently no Hawaii cases dealing with this point.\u00a0 Courts have usually dealt with the evidentiary function of the actor's conduct in terms of whether it constituted an act of perpetration rather than merely preparation.[11]\u00a0 The Code focuses more directly and clearly on the function of the requirement without seeking precision where precision is not practicable.\n\u00a0 The problem of impossibility, which the Code deals with in subsection (1) and (2), was not covered by any prior statute.\u00a0 Moreover, there is apparently no Hawaii case law on this point.\u00a0 However, this section is in accord with recent penal revisions in other jurisdictions.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Evidence held sufficient to support attempted rape and attempted assault.\u00a0 56 H. 664, 548 P.2d 271 (1976).\n\u00a0 Intent being essential element of attempt, charge of attempt to commit theft was insufficient where there was no allegation of intent.\u00a0 61 H. 177, 599 P.2d 285 (1979).\n\u00a0 Instruction concerning \"substantial step\".\u00a0 63 H. 105, 621 P.2d 381 (1980).\n\u00a0 Concealment of clothes in bag was a substantial step in the course of attempted theft.\u00a0 67 H. 581, 698 P.2d 293 (1985).\n\u00a0 Sexual assault in the fourth degree and attempted sexual assault in the fourth degree are included offenses of attempted sexual assault in the second degree, within the meaning of \u00a7701-109(4)(c).\u00a0 79 H. 46, 897 P.2d 973 (1995).\n\u00a0 Defendant charged with attempted murder, in violation of \u00a7707-701.5 and this section, may be convicted of attempted manslaughter, in violation of this section and \u00a7707-702(2).\u00a0 80 H. 27, 904 P.2d 912 (1995).\n\u00a0 This section combined with \u00a7707-702(1)(a) does not give rise to the offense of attempted manslaughter.\u00a0 80 H. 27, 904 P.2d 912 (1995).\n\u00a0 A person commits the offense of attempted prohibited possession of a firearm, pursuant to subsections (1)(b) and (3), and \u00a7134-7(b), if he or she intentionally engages in conduct that, under the circumstances as he or she believes them to be, constitutes a substantial step in a course of conduct intended to culminate in his or her commission of the offense of prohibited possession of a firearm.\u00a0 93 H. 199, 998 P.2d 479 (2000).\n\u00a0 As the offense of attempted prohibited possession of a firearm under \u00a7134-7 does not include a result-of-conduct element and subsection (2) does not therefore apply, trial court instruction erroneously defined the state of mind necessary to prove the offense of attempted prohibited possession of a firearm as something less than intentional, as required by subsection (1)(b).\u00a0 93 H. 199, 998 P.2d 479 (2000).\n\u00a0 Pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7701-109(4)(b), 134-7(b), and subsections (1)(b) and (3), attempted prohibited possession of a firearm is an included offense of prohibited possession of a firearm.\u00a0 93 H. 199, 998 P.2d 479 (2000).\n\u00a0 Where victim testified that defendant sexually assaulted victim in each of the four ways alleged, which was supported by testimony of victim's brother and uncle, evidence was sufficient to prove that defendant intentionally engaged in conduct under the circumstances that defendant believed them to be, the conduct constituted a substantial step in the course of conduct, and defendant intended that the course of conduct culminate in sexual penetration with victim, thus supporting defendant's convictions.\u00a0 126 H. 383, 271 P.3d 1142 (2012).\n\u00a0 Crime of attempted manslaughter is an included offense of attempted murder.\u00a0 7 H. App. 291, 757 P.2d 1175 (1987).\n\u00a0 Trial court must instruct jury as to what specific facts jury must find before it decides whether defendant is guilty of attempted sexual assault in first degree.\u00a0 77 H. 177 (App.), 880 P.2d 1224 (1994).\n\u00a0 Where there was no evidence, independent of defendant's extrajudicial confession, of the corpus delicti of attempted sexual assault of victim by defendant, defendant's conviction reversed.\u00a0 103 H. 490 (App.), 83 P.3d 753 (2003).\n\u00a0 Trial court's omission of the \"strongly corroborative\" paragraph in the attempted assault in the second degree instructions was presumptively prejudicial and omission was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u00a0 104 H. 517 (App.), 92 P.3d 1027 (2004).\n\u00a0 There was insufficient evidence that defendant took a substantial step toward the distribution of at least one-eighth ounce of methamphetamine in defendant's possession where there was no evidence that defendant had engaged in negotiations, offered, or agreed to distribute any of the methamphetamine found in defendant's possession.\u00a0 107 H. 144 (App.), 111 P.3d 39 (2005).\n\u00a0 Discussed: \u00a086 H. 1, 946 P.2d 955 (1997).\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7705-500 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 M.P.C., Tentative Draft No. 10, comments at 26 (1960).\n\u00a0\n2.\u00a0 Under this Code conventional arson has been incorporated as one form of criminal property damage, see chapter 708.\n\u00a0\n3.\u00a0 Prop.
