[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7705-501\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 When a defendant attempts to aid another in the commission of a crime and the other person attempts or commits the substantive offense, the defendant is liable, under the complicity provisions,[1] for the conduct of the other person.\u00a0 However, where the other person does not attempt or commit the crime, the complicity sections and ordinary attempt definitions do not cover the situation.\u00a0 Subsection (1) provides that the defendant will be guilty of attempt to commit the crime if complicity would have resulted had the other person attempted or committed the substantive offense.\u00a0 For example:\u00a0 A knows that B plans to kill C; B is unaware of A's knowledge and does not seek A's assistance; A prevents a warning from reaching C which would otherwise have reached him; B changes his mind before engaging in any conduct; A is guilty of attempted murder.\n\u00a0 In one other respect the complicity sections and the attempt sections operate jointly.\u00a0 If a defendant engages in some conduct intended to aid another but does not complete the course of conduct sufficient for the purpose, the question then posed is whether the more limited conduct would result in complicity under \u00a7\u00a7702-222 through 226.\u00a0 Section 702-222 provides that complicity may rest on attempt to aid another.\u00a0 In determining whether the defendant's limited conduct is sufficient to constitute an attempt to aid, the standard of substantiality as set forth in \u00a7705-500 should be followed.\u00a0 If A, in the example stated above, was apprehended before he was able to prevent a message of warning from reaching C, the question of A's liability would turn on the substantiality of his action, i.e., whether his conduct was strongly corroborative of his criminal intent.\n\u00a0 Subsection (2) is intended to eliminate the defense of impossibility.\u00a0 In the example stated above, A would be guilty notwithstanding the fact, e.g., that C died from natural causes before the warning possibly could have reached him.\n\u00a0 This section represents an addition to Hawaii law.\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7705-501 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 Cf. \u00a7\u00a7702-222 to 226."
