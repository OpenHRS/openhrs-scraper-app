[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; gen ch 1993]\n\u00a0\nCross References\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Liability for conduct of another; complicity, see \u00a7702-222.\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7705-510\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Criminal solicitation can rationally be viewed a number of ways.\u00a0 It can be argued that solicitation is not the proper subject of penal sanction because the resulting offense or anti-social conduct in such cases is dependent upon the independent will of another.\u00a0 Also, the solicitor, by the solicitor's reluctance to engage in the proscribed conduct or cause the proscribed result oneself, tends to indicate that the solicitor does not present a serious danger.\u00a0 On the other hand, because of the solicitor's connivance and subtlety and because of the criminal cooperation which the solicitor might foster, the solicitor may be thought to create special dangers calling for special sanctions.\u00a0 The Code adopts the position that the disposition of the solicitor presents sufficient dangers to warrant intervention and that the penal liability of the solicitor should not depend upon the fortuity of whether the person solicited agrees to or engages in the requested conduct, or adopts or undertakes to cause the requested result.\u00a0 In such cases penal liability would be imposed on a conspiracy or complicity basis.\n\u00a0 The formulation of subsection (1) is intended to accomplish two purposes.\u00a0 First, it makes clear that, with respect to the culpability of the defendant, the defendant must act with the intent to promote or facilitate the commission of a crime.\u00a0 Second, the subsection resolves the problem presented by equivocal solicitations.\u00a0 Many innocent remarks or innuendoes could be interpreted as invitations to commit an offense--e.g., sexual and bribery offenses.\u00a0 Furthermore, political and social agitation could, in some instances, be misinterpreted as an invitation to violate laws disapproved by the agitator.\u00a0 To avoid these problems, the Code provides that the conduct or result commanded, encouraged, or requested must be \"specified by the definition of an offense.\"\u00a0 Thus, general, equivocal remarks--such as the espousal of a political philosophy recognizing the purported necessity of violence--would not be sufficiently specific vis-a-vis the definition of an offense to constitute criminal solicitation.\n\u00a0 Subsection (2) makes it immaterial that the defendant's communication does not reach the person whom the defendant intends to solicit as long as the defendant's conduct is designed to effect the communication.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order for liability to attach under this subsection the last proximate act must be done to effect communication with the party intended to be solicited.\u00a0 Conduct falling short of the last act was excluded because it was considered too remote from the completed crime to manifest sufficient firmness of purpose by the actor.\u00a0 The crucial manifestation of dangerousness here lies in the endeavor to communicate the incriminating message to another person, it being wholly fortuitous whether such message was actually received.\u00a0 Liability should attach, therefore, even though the message is not received by the contemplated recipient, and should also attach even though further conduct might be required on the solicitor's part before the party solicited could proceed to the crime.[1]\n\u00a0 Criminal solicitation was termed instigation under prior Hawaii law.[2]\u00a0 One was guilty of instigation if one \"instigates another to the commission of any offense, by commanding, soliciting or offering to hire, or otherwise endeavoring to induce him to commit the offense.\"[3]\u00a0 The Code is generally in keeping with this definition.\u00a0 It is to be noted that, under prior law, Hawaii was one of the few states which, accepting the tenets of modern penal theory, recognized that the solicitation of any crime is itself a crime:\u00a0 the majority of jurisdictions only regard as criminal the solicitation of the more serious crimes.[4]\u00a0 Moreover, Hawaii has long recognized that, as the Code provides, the actual degree of influence which the solicitor may effect is immaterial, so long as the solicitor intends to promote the commission of the crime.[5]\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7705-510 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 M.P.C., Tentative Draft No. 10, comments at 89 (1960).\n\u00a0\n2.\u00a0 H.R.S. \u00a7702-11.\n\u00a0\n3.\u00a0 Id.\n\u00a0\n4.\u00a0 Wechsler, Jones, and Korn, The Treatment of Inchoate Crimes in the Model Penal Code of The American Law Institute: Attempt, Solicitation, and Conspiracy, 61 Colum.
