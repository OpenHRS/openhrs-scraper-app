[L 1995, c 119, pt of \u00a72; am L 1999, c 226, \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7708A-3\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Act 226, Session Laws 1999, amended this section by, among other things, creating a class C felony for persons guilty of money laundering when the value or aggregate value of the property involved is less than $10,000 but greater than $8,000, and imposing fines of no more than $16,000 or no more than twice the value of the property, whichever is greater, upon individuals found guilty of a class C felony.\u00a0 The legislature found that the minimum $10,000 ceiling for a money laundering transaction enables criminal organizations to avoid prosecution by structuring their illegal transactions\u00a0 to remain below $10,000.\u00a0 The legislature further found that this frustrates attempts by law enforcement and prosecutors to pursue criminal penalties against money launderers until the amount that they can prove has been laundered surpasses the $10,000 level.\u00a0 The legislature agreed that adding a lower offense for money laundering a lower sum would appropriately penalize such behavior.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1494."
