App. 644, 623 P.2d 898 (1981).\n\u00a0 Evidence of moneys wrongfully converted, constituting violation of subsection (1)(b).\u00a0 1 H. App. 658, 624 P.2d 381 (1981).\n\u00a0 Where store security manager's testimony regarding the price/value of items, based on a universal price code with the price on the item that the manager verified through the store register system, was inadmissible hearsay, State failed to introduce substantial evidence of the value of the items necessary to support the charged offense of second or third degree theft; however, evidence was sufficient to support conviction of lesser included offense of fourth degree theft.\u00a0 95 H. 169 (App.), 19 P.3d 752 (2001)."
