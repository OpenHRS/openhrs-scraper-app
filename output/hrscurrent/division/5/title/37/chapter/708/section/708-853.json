[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; am L 1988, c 155, \u00a74; gen ch 1992]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7\u00a7708-851 TO 708-853\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 As the drafters of the Model Penal Code noted, a revision of the criminal law which deals effectively with theft, fraud, attempt, and complicity diminishes the need for a separate offense of forgery.\u00a0 However, as in the case of the M.P.C.,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We retain forgery as a distinct offense partly because the concept is so embedded in statute and popular understanding that it would be inconvenient and unlikely that any legislature would completely abandon it, and partly in recognition of the special effectiveness of forgery as a means of undermining public confidence in important symbols of commerce, and of perpetrating large scale frauds.[1]\n\u00a0 The Code establishes three degrees of forgery.\u00a0 The simple and least serious offense is forgery in the third degree, and involves the false making, completion, or alteration of any written instrument.\u00a0 The requisite state of mind is an \"intent to defraud,\" which is specially defined to include knowledge that the actor is facilitating injury to the valuable interest of another, as well as intent to accomplish such injury.[2]\u00a0 \"Written instrument\" is broadly defined by \u00a7708-850(1) to include not only written or printed matter, but also coins, stamps, badges, seals, etc., which are evidence of value, right, privilege, or identification.\u00a0 Falsely making, falsely completing, and falsely altering a written instrument are also specifically defined in subsections 708-850(4), (5), and (6), respectively:\u00a0 the essential common element is that the final product falsely purports to be an authentic creation of its ostensible maker.\u00a0 Because truly serious forgeries are dealt with under the offenses of first or second degree forgery, forgery in the third degree is made a misdemeanor.\n\u00a0 If the forged instrument is one which affects a legal right or interest, the offense is considered forgery in the second degree, and the sanction is increased to a class C felony.\u00a0 This category includes wills, deeds, contractual instruments, and generally all negotiable instruments and instruments relating to secured transactions.[3]\u00a0 These instruments are more stringently protected because of (1) the greater potential for individual harm which may generally result from the forgery of such instruments, and (2) the serious business and economic disruptions which would result from the undermining of public confidence in such matters.\n\u00a0 Forgery, in any of its forms, of governmental or corporate financial issues or instruments, constitutes a class B felony.\u00a0 Impairment of public confidence in instruments or symbols of commerce could have disastrous effect upon governmental processes and the economy in general and clearly represents the most aggravated form of forgery.\u00a0 It is significant, in this regard, that such instruments were the first to be protected by the common law of forgery.[4]\u00a0 Moreover, it is felt that an additional danger exists since the average citizen cannot easily protect oneself against skillfully made forgeries of this kind; and professional criminals are most likely to concentrate on forging such instruments.\u00a0 Note that a forgery in the first degree must appear as part of a series.\u00a0 Thus, for example, only stocks, bonds, stamps, and securities which represent part of a larger issue fall within the definition of this offense.\u00a0 How many individual instruments constitute an issue is a matter left to case-by-case judicial interpretation.[5]\n\u00a0 The Code's definition of the simple offense of forgery is nearly identical to that found in prior Hawaii law:\u00a0 \"Forgery is the fraudulent making or altering a [sic] writing with the intent to deceive another and prejudice him in some right.\"[6]\u00a0 Moreover, Hawaii recognized two degrees of forgery.\u00a0 Forgery of a deed of conveyance, lease, promissory note, bill of exchange, due bill, check, order, and the like, involving a value of $100 or more, was roughly equivalent to the Code's forgery in the second degree, but drew a sentence similar to the Code's class B felony.\u00a0 All other forgery was forgery in the second degree and carried a sentence similar to the Code's class C felony.\u00a0 It is felt that the Code's gradation, solely according to the kind of instrument forged, is more indicative of the actual and potential degree of public and private harm involved.\u00a0 Moreover, the division of the offense into three degrees provides for more equitable treatment of forgery offenders.\n\u00a0 Hawaii law previously provided an extraordinary penalty for repeated forgery offenses in the form of an additional sentence up to one-half the maximum allowed for last conviction.[7]\u00a0 Such severe treatment is rather difficult to justify rationally, and is found in neither the Model Penal Code nor the recent revisions of other states.\u00a0 The Code omits such selective sentencing provisions.\u00a0 The problem of habitual offenders is dealt with generally under chapter 706 (Disposition of Convicted Defendants).\n\u00a0\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON \u00a7\u00a7708-851 TO 708-853\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Act 155, Session Laws 1988, added the term \"endorses\" to these sections.\u00a0 Previously, forging a written instrument did not include false endorsements as a method of forging a written instrument; therefore, false endorsement was prosecuted as a theft.\u00a0 False endorsement, as a theft charge, carried a lighter sentence than forgery.\u00a0 The legislature felt the inclusion of false endorsements in these sections would strengthen the existing forgery laws.\u00a0 House Standing Committee Report No. 467-88, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2550.\n\u00a0 Act 243, Session Laws 1997, amended \u00a7\u00a7708-851 and 708-852 by making it an offense of forgery to fraudulently encode magnetic ink character recognition numbers on a written instrument.\u00a0 The legislature found that increasingly advanced technology has changed the way in which commercial paper can be handled between parties.\u00a0 One of the technological changes involved the use of magnetic character recognition numbers that enable scanners to quickly obtain information from the document.\u00a0 Changing the magnetic codes effectively tells the scanner different information than that intended, making it a forgery in fact, if not in name.\u00a0 However, that type of document alteration was not currently prohibited by law.\u00a0 The legislature found that the Act would protect parties in that type of situation.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1551, House Standing Committee Report No. 987.\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7\u00a7708-851 To 708-853 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 M.P.C., Tentative Draft No. 11, comments at 80 (1960).\n\u00a0\n2.\u00a0 Cf. \u00a7708-800.\n\u00a0\n3.\u00a0 Prop.
