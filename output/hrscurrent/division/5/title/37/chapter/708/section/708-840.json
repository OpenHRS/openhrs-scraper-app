[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; am L 1983, c 68, \u00a71; am L 1986, c 314, \u00a768; gen ch 1993; am L 1998, c 68, \u00a71; am L 2006, c 116, \u00a77 and c 230, \u00a741; am L 2013, c 255, \u00a72; am L 2014, c 111, \u00a721]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Act of violence or intimidation need not be done for very purpose of taking the property to constitute robbery.\u00a0 56 H. 343, 537 P.2d 724 (1975).\n\u00a0 In absence of evidence that gun was not loaded or capable of being fired, an inference exists that it was capable of inflicting the harm which the robber threatened and was a dangerous instrument within this section.\u00a0 57 H. 150, 552 P.2d 357 (1976).\n\u00a0 Whether instrument used in robbery is a dangerous instrument is a question of fact for jury to resolve.\u00a0 57 H. 365, 556 P.2d 569 (1976).\n\u00a0 Assault by person armed with dangerous instrument with intent to rob is within subsection (1)(b)(i).\u00a0 59 H. 148, 577 P.2d 793 (1978).\n\u00a0 Accomplice.\u00a0 62 H. 25, 608 P.2d 855 (1980).\n\u00a0 Applicability of claim of right defense.\u00a0 62 H. 25, 608 P.2d 855 (1980).\n\u00a0 An unloaded gun as a dangerous instrument.\u00a0 63 H. 405, 629 P.2d 626 (1981).\n\u00a0 Threatened use of force against several persons did not constitute more than one count of robbery.\u00a0 65 H. 156, 648 P.2d 197 (1982); 4 H. App. 573, 670 P.2d 1290 (1983).\n\u00a0 Firearms are per se dangerous weapons.\u00a0 69 H. 44, 731 P.2d 1261 (1987).\n\u00a0 Jury instruction should have stated that if jury found defendant committed attempted murder and robbery concurrently, it need not render two verdicts.\u00a0 70 H. 618, 780 P.2d 1097 (1989).\n\u00a0 Defendant convicted of both kidnapping and robbery because crimes did not occur concurrently.\u00a0 71 H. 46, 781 P.2d 662 (1989).\n\u00a0 Trial judge erred in refusing to instruct jury regarding the possible merger of the robbery and kidnapping counts against defendant.\u00a0 77 H. 17, 881 P.2d 504 (1994).\n\u00a0 First degree burglary not an included offense of first degree robbery.\u00a0 81 H. 309, 916 P.2d 1210 (1996).\n\u00a0 Theft and attempted theft, regardless of degree, are included offenses of first degree robbery.\u00a0 81 H. 309, 916 P.2d 1210 (1996).\n\u00a0 A victim's awareness of the theft is a necessary element of robbery pursuant to subsection (1)(b)(ii).\u00a0 86 H. 37, 947 P.2d 349 (1997).\n\u00a0 Where defendant's conviction and sentence under this section was an included offense under \u00a7134-6(a) and defendant's convictions under both \u00a7134-4(a) and this section violated \u00a7701-109(1)(a), defendant's conviction and sentence under this section reversed.\u00a0 91 H. 33, 979 P.2d 1059 (1999).\n\u00a0 Where defendant's convictions were premised upon the use of \"any firearm\" and language of indictments and trial court's instructions \"to wit, a semiautomatic pistol\" did not alter the statutory elements of \u00a7\u00a7134-6, 134-7, or this section, trial court's error of not providing definition of \"semiautomatic firearm\" did not warrant reversal of convictions of first degree robbery, carrying or use of firearm in commission of separate felony, or felon in possession of firearm.\u00a0 91 H. 33, 979 P.2d 1059 (1999).\n\u00a0 As subsection (1)(b)(i) does not require that a defendant use force in order to compel another person to acquiesce in his or her taking of property, it is not an element of the offense that the person against whom the defendant is alleged to have used force, or the owner of the property, be aware of the theft; thus, trial court did not err in failing to instruct the jury that the \"victim\" of the theft--whether the person against whom force was used or the owner of the property taken--must be aware of the theft.\u00a0 99 H. 390, 56 P.3d 692 (2002).\n\u00a0 Whether a loaded pellet pistol is a dangerous instrument is a question of fact.\u00a0 1 H. App. 481, 620 P.2d 1087 (1980).\n\u00a0 Where defendant did not use force in the course of committing theft, no first degree robbery committed within meaning of paragraph (1)(b)(i).\u00a0 9 H. App. 263, 833 P.2d 902 (1992).\n\u00a0 Instructions constituted plain error, where (1) court instructed jury that a knife is a dangerous instrument; and (2) instruction defined the imminent use of force.\u00a0 9 H. App. 628, 859 P.2d 925 (1993).\n\u00a0 Where there was substantial evidence that the manner in which the \"little black stick\" was used was capable of producing serious bodily injury as defined under \u00a7707-700, minor was properly convicted as an accomplice to robbery in the first degree under this section.\u00a0 107 H. 439 (App.), 114 P.3d 945 (2005).\n\u00a0 As robbery in the first degree under subsection (1)(b)(ii) does not include the element required under \u00a7708-810(1)(c) for burglary in the first degree of intentionally entering or remaining unlawfully in a building, it was possible for defendant to commit robbery in the first degree without committing burglary in the first degree; thus the crimes are not included in each other and do not merge.\u00a0 109 H. 327 (App.), 126 P.3d 370 (2005).\n\u00a0 There was sufficient evidence to convict defendant of robbery in the first degree under this section where, inter alia, victim testified at trial that when defendant's brother put a knife to victim's neck and asked for victim's money, defendant held down victim's hands, and that both asked the victim where the victim's money was.\u00a0 123 H. 456 (App.), 235 P.3d 1168 (2010).\n\u00a0 Where jury convicted defendant of robbery in the first degree under this section, error by circuit court when it failed to instruct jury on robbery in the second degree under \u00a7708-841 and theft in the fourth degree under \u00a7708-833, which were included offenses of robbery in the first degree, was harmless.\u00a0 123 H. 456 (App.), 235 P.3d 1168 (2010)."
