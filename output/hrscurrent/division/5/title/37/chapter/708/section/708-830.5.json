[L 1986, c 314, \u00a763; am L 1992, c 289, \u00a71; am L 1993, c 14, \u00a71; am L 2006, c 116, \u00a76; am L 2014, c 111, \u00a720]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Where defendant returned new vehicle after 72 hour possession and prosecution was unable to prove any economic loss to car dealership, no intent to deprive dealership of significant portion of vehicle's economic value, use, or benefit.\u00a0 86 H. 207, 948 P.2d 1048 (1997).\n\u00a0 Where appeals court correctly held that defendant's theft offense under \u00a7708-830(1) and subsection (1)(a) required proof of a value element which defendant's federal conspiracy offense did not, and was designed to prevent a substantially different harm--the deprivation of property rights versus the threat posed by agreements to commit criminal conduct, defendant's prosecution in state court was not barred under \u00a7701-112 and the circuit court did not err in denying defendant's motion to dismiss in this respect. 126 H. 205, 269 P.3d 740 (2011).\n\u00a0 Based on petitioner's performance of petitioner's part of the contract between homeowner and petitioner and the failure of the respondent State to produce evidence of the value of the work completed by petitioner, the State failed to establish that petitioner deprived homeowner of property exceeding $20,000 in value, the threshold for first degree theft.\u00a0 129 H. 414, 301 P.3d 1255 (2013)."
