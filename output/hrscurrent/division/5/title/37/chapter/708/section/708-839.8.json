[L 2002, c 224, pt of \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 As this section does not require impersonation of a person in order to constitute the offense, only the transmission of a person's personal information with the intent to commit the specified theft offense, the circuit court erred in its construction of this section.\u00a0 125 H. 172 (App.), 254 P.3d 483 (2011).\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7\u00a7708-839.6 TO 708-839.8\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Act 224, Session Laws 2002, added these sections to provide criminal penalties for persons who commit identity theft of another individual.\u00a0 The legislature found that misappropriation of personal identification information was on the rise.\u00a0 Act 224 addresses the criminal conduct associated with intentional identity theft.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 25-02."
