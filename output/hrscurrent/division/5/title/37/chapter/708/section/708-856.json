[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; gen ch 1993]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7708-856\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 The conduct proscribed by this section does not constitute forgery, but is typically preparatory to theft by deception.\u00a0 A signature is not \"property\" within the meaning of \u00a7708-800, and hence cannot be the subject of a theft provision.\u00a0 Nor does forgery cover the result, since the instrument is precisely what it purports to be, i.e., an authentic creation of its ostensible maker.\u00a0 But since the individual culpability and probable results of such actions are so little distinguishable from those of forgery, it is felt that a penalty commensurate with that for the lowest forgery offense (forgery in the third degree, \u00a7708-853) ought to attach to obtaining a signature by deception.\u00a0 Note that the requisite intent to defraud, as defined in \u00a7708-800, is the same as that required for the forgery offenses."
