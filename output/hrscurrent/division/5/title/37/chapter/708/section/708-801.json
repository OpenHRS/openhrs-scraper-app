App. 644, 623 P.2d 898 (1981).\n\u00a0 Due process right violated where circuit court's instruction to jury regarding the statutory presumption created by paragraph (4) failed to further instruct jury pursuant to HRE rule 306(a) that the presumption is merely a permissible inference of fact and that in order to apply the presumption, the jury must find that the presumed fact exists beyond a reasonable doubt.\u00a0 88 H. 216 (App.), 965 P.2d 149 (1998).\n\u00a0 Under \u00a7702-206, the term \"intentional\", as applied to the value-attendant-circumstance element of the insurance fraud offense under \u00a7431:10C-307.7, means \"believes\"; also, paragraph (4) indicates that either a defendant's \"belief\" or \"knowledge\" is sufficient to establish an intentional or knowing state of mind as to the value element; thus, pursuant to \u00a7702-204, as a \"reckless\" state of mind was applicable to the value element of the insurance fraud offense, defendant was not exposed to a conviction based on a state of mind lower than what was required.\u00a0 117 H. 26 (App.), 175 P.3d 136 (2007)."
