[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; gen ch 1993]\n\u00a0\nRevision Note\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 In subsection (1)(b) and (c), \"or\" deleted pursuant to \u00a723G-15.\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7708-870\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 This section proscribes knowingly or recklessly engaging in certain business practices likely to deceive customers or clients.\u00a0 The basic purpose of the section is to provide a single punishment and simple definition for various offenses related to false weights and measures, adulteration, and mislabeling of commodities.\n\u00a0 This section is not intended as detailed regulation of the subject area, but rather only to control the criminal penalties utilized to enforce legislation dealing with deceptive business practices.\u00a0 However, recognizing the tremendous body of law specifically regulating various deceptive business practices and the questionable wisdom of a wholesale modification of that body of law, subsection (5) is included to provide that this section shall not apply where statutes outside the Code specifically provide a penalty for the deceptive practice involved.\u00a0 It should be emphasized that criminal sanctions in this area are an extreme measure, and generally not as effective an enforcement tool as statutory licensing, injunction, and private actions.[1]\n\u00a0 Subsection (1) defines the offense and is largely self- explanatory.\u00a0 It should be noted, with respect to the state of mind required for conviction, that although (1) recklessness is a lower level of culpability than acting knowingly, and (2) there is a slight redundancy in including the word \"knowingly\" in the definition of the offense,[2] the clarity of language that is achieved is worth the technical redundancy.\u00a0 Unlike the theft offenses, there is no requirement that (1) defendant obtain property or services, (2) that the defendant obtain by deception, or (3) that the defendant act intentionally.\u00a0 The definitions in subsections (2) and (3) are also self-explanatory.\u00a0 However, it should be pointed out, that all current regulatory standards are included by reference.\u00a0 Where no statutory or regulatory standards exist, it becomes encumbent upon the prosecution to prove a violation of established commercial usage.\n\u00a0 Previous Hawaii law contained many penal provisions for deceptive business practices within Title 38 of the Hawaii Revised Statutes dealing with crimes.\u00a0 Most deceptive practices were covered in the chapter on \"Gross Cheat.\"\u00a0 The penalties in this chapter did not treat similar conduct equally.\n\u00a0 The same anomalies will continue to occur in general regulatory provisions.\u00a0 Deceptive business practices relating to gasoline, fuel, and motor oil warrant a $500 fine or six months' imprisonment or both.[3]\u00a0 For selling other than \"pure quality\" liquor the available sanction is the same,[4] but for selling misbranded or adulterated milk, imprisonment for one year is authorized.[5]\u00a0 When this section of the Code is compared with regulatory legislation outside the Code, inconsistencies in sentences can be found.\u00a0 However, these anomalies and inconsistencies are the inevitable result of our determination, in subsection (5), not to use the Penal Code as a vehicle for the wholesale reform of regulatory legislation relating to deceptive business practices.\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7708-870 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 See Prop.
