[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7708-828\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 This section recognizes that the use value of a person's property may be impaired by the use of noxious substances without the involvement of tampering (\u00a7\u00a7708-826 to 827) or actual damage (\u00a7\u00a7708-820 to 823).\u00a0 This form of interference with the use of property can be significantly grave to warrant the low grade of criminal sanction provided by this section.\n\u00a0 Under previous Hawaii law, the conduct described in this section would fall within the ambit of the indiscriminately-defined offense of common nuisance.[1]\u00a0 The Code sharpens the focus and definition of the offense, as it relates to noxious substances, and reduces slightly the possible penalty.\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7708-828 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 H.R.S. \u00a7727-1."
