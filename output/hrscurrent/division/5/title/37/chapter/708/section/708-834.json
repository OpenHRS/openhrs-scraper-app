[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; am L 1979, c 106, \u00a78; am L 1980, c 232, \u00a741; gen ch 1993; am L 1997, c 383, \u00a769]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7708-834\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Both the defenses allowed under \u00a7708-834(1) are probably unnecessary in light of an informed reading of the substantive definitions of the various modes of theft.\u00a0 The existence of either condition (a) or (b) would relieve the actor of the culpability required to establish the offense:\u00a0 the actor could not have intended to deprive another of property (or refuse payment for services) unless the actor was aware that the property or services were that of another; and a claim of right, assuming that it amounts to a belief that the actor is the true owner, would not only indicate that the actor did not have the requisite mental state, it would constitute a mistake of fact defense under \u00a7702-218.\u00a0 The summary and restatement of this subsection is principally for purposes of clarity and emphasis.\n\u00a0 The marital defense of subsection (2) is based upon various theories.\u00a0 First, the uncertainty of ownership of much household property, together with the potential bitterness of interspousal conflict, provide numerous opportunities for a miscarriage of justice.[1]\u00a0 Alternatively, it is said that household belongings, defined in subsection (3), constitute a kind of \"common pool of wealth,\" and that misappropriations in this context are so generally tolerated as not to deviate substantially from socially-accepted norms.\u00a0 A wife who rifles her husband's wallet, or a husband who pawns his wife's jewelry, does not present a grave danger to the community, so long as the activity is so confined.\u00a0 Finally, criminal courts are unsuited to handle breakdowns in the family structure of which interspousal theft complaints are only a symptom.[2]\n\u00a0 Subsection (4) is intended to cover the situation where an aggrieved person attempts to seek an informal solution by threatening legal action unless restitution, indemnification, or compensation is made.\u00a0 The most significant instance of this device is the waiver of prosecution commonly offered by insurance companies in exchange for the return of valuable merchandise.\u00a0 The rationale here is that it is hardly fair to penalize someone for trying to recover one's own goods (or the value thereof), nor could the penal law realistically expect to suppress such natural inclinations.\n\u00a0 Subsection (5) merely requires that the interest which the actor asserts under a claim of right must be inconsistent with that of the victim.\u00a0 The premise is that if the interest is not inconsistent, it does not justify the actor's possession as opposed to that of the victim.\u00a0 Furthermore, it is felt that \"co- owners should be as well protected against the depredations of other co-owners as they are against outsiders.\"[3]\n\u00a0\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON \u00a7708-834\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Act 106, Session Laws 1979, amended this section as part of a consolidation of laws pertaining to extortion.\n\u00a0 Act 232, Session Laws 1980, added subsection (4) and the words \"co-interest not a defense\" in the section heading to restore language erroneously omitted by L 1979, Act 107, \u00a78.\n\u00a0 Act 383, Session Laws 1997, amended this section to provide a defense to prosecution for theft of property to reciprocal beneficiaries.\u00a0 In establishing the status of reciprocal beneficiaries, the Act provides certain rights and benefits and represents a commitment to provide substantially similar government rights to those couples who are barred by law from marriage.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 2.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Claim of right defense discussed.\u00a0 62 H. 25, 608 P.2d 855 (1980).\n\u00a0 Claim of right defense to theft under this section does not apply in a prosecution for robbery.\u00a0 83 H. 264, 925 P.2d 1088 (1996).\n\u00a0 Appeals court erred in concluding that petitioner adduced sufficient evidence to warrant instruction on a claim-of-right defense where petitioner's theory of defense warranted a general mistake of fact instruction; a claim-of-right defense must encompass some form of pre-existing ownership or possession of specific property, and petitioner's claim of entitlement to welfare benefits was not one of \"true ownership\" in \"specific personal property\", but merely a belief in entitlement to some undefined future benefit that was never in petitioner's possession at any point prior to the alleged theft.\u00a0 122 H. 271, 226 P.3d 441 (2010).\n\u00a0 Subsection (1)(b)'s defense was not applicable to offense of unauthorized control of propelled vehicle (\u00a7708-836).\u00a0 10 H. App. 200, 862 P.2d 1073 (1993).\n\u00a0 Trial court erred harmfully in excluding, pursuant to HRE rules 401 and 403, defendant's exhibit with respect to defendant's theft-by-deception charges under \u00a7708-830(2), on the grounds that defendant's analysis of the tax laws was irrelevant and that evidence of defendant's legal theories would confuse the jury, where evidence that defendant, based on defendant's understanding of the tax laws, had a good faith belief that defendant did not owe taxes on defendant's wages was relevant to whether defendant acted by deception and whether defendant had a defense under subsection (1).\u00a0 119 H. 60 (App.), 193 P.3d 1260 (2008).\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7708-834 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 M.P.C., Tentative Draft No. 2, comments at 104 (1954).\n\u00a0\n2.\u00a0 Id. at 104-5.\n\u00a0\n3.\u00a0 See Prop.
