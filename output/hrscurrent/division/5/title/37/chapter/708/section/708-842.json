[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; am L 2006, c 230, \u00a743]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7708-842\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 The nature and operation of this section is concisely explained by the Model Penal Code:\nThis provision is unusual only insofar as it makes classification of robbery depend in part on behavior after the theft might be said to have been accomplished.\u00a0 The thief's willingness to use force against those who would restrain him in flight strongly suggests that he would have employed it to effect the theft had there been need for it.\u00a0 No rule-of-thumb is proposed to delimit the time and space of \"flight,\" which should be interpreted in accordance with the rationale.\u00a0 The concept of \"fresh pursuit\" will be helpful in suggesting realistic bounds between the occasion of the theft and a later occasion when the escaped thief is apprehended.[1]\n\u00a0 Previous Hawaii statutory law failed to provide a standard for the determination of the duration of the \"theft\" aspect of a robbery--a standard which is needed in order to determine when the employment of force or threatened force converts the \"theft\" into a \"robbery.\"\n\u00a0\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON \u00a7708-842\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Act 230, Session Laws 2006, established motor vehicle theft as part of the offenses of robbery in the first and second degrees.\u00a0 House Standing Committee Report No. 665-06.\u00a0 Act 230 amended this section to conform to the amendments made to the offenses of robbery in the first and second degrees.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Theft and attempted theft, regardless of degree, are included offenses of first degree robbery.\u00a0 81 H. 309, 916 P.2d 1210 (1996).\n\u00a0 Force was not used \"in the course of committing theft\" where force used was while defendant was returning stolen liquor bottle to store owner.\u00a0 9 H.
