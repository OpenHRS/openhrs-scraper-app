[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; am L 1993, c 33, \u00a72]\n\u00a0\nRevision Note\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 In subsection (3), paragraph designations deleted and punctuation changed pursuant to \u00a723G-15.\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7708-857\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 This section is concerned with the passage of worthless negotiable instruments where the actor has knowledge that the instrument will not be honored.\u00a0 Originally, bad check legislation was necessitated by the common-law limitations on promissory fraud: misrepresentation of a future fact was not sufficient to establish theft by deception.\u00a0 Such artificial distinctions are largely obviated by the definition of \"deception\" used in the Code's theft provisions.[1]\u00a0 As noted in the comments to the Proposed Michigan Code,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the elimination of the promissory fraud doctrine thus eliminates the need for a bad check statute in its traditional form.\u00a0 This might suggest that there is no point served in continuing a bad check statute in the Draft.\u00a0 In answer, the statute can serve a useful purpose when the merchant or bank that is in fact defrauded does not wish to prosecute but the bank on which the bad check is drawn does.[2]\nThis section, moreover, protects the prevailing system of negotiable paper in addition to those individuals involved in a given case.\u00a0 Since emphasis in \"bad check\" cases ought to be placed upon the theft, rather than on the bad check itself, the sanction provided for this offense is relatively mild, i.e., a misdemeanor, and the grade of the offense does not, as in the case of theft offenses, vary according to the amount involved.\n\u00a0 The incorporation of the Uniform Commercial Code's definitions of \"issue,\" \"negotiable instrument,\" and \"negotiation\" in subsection (3), is intended to insure that in this area, where protection of commercial transactions are reinforced with criminal sanctions, the civil and penal law are closely correlated.\u00a0 The use of the U.C.C.'s definition of \"negotiation\" insures that the indorser with knowledge or expectation of ultimate nonpayment, as well as the drawer, with such knowledge or expectation, will be covered.\n\u00a0 Under the evidentiary rules established in subsection (2), the prosecution fulfills its initial burden of proving intent by demonstrating, beyond a reasonable doubt, either that the issuer had no account with the drawee, or that such an instrument was not made good within ten days of receipt of notice of dishonor.\u00a0 Again, the definitions of the Uniform Commercial Code are used for both convenience and uniformity.\u00a0 Note, however, the modifications toward leniency necessitated in adapting a civil statute to criminal use:\u00a0 actual, rather than constructive, receipt of notice of dishonor is required before the time in which the actor must make good begins to run.\u00a0 The time period required by subsection (2)(b) does not prevent prosecution before the time has elapsed, but only denies to the prosecution the benefit of that particular evidentiary provision before the stated time has elapsed.\n\u00a0 Previous Hawaii law defined this offense similarly, except that Hawaii law required an intent to defraud.[3]\u00a0 The Code provides that knowledge of insufficient funds is adequate culpability for the imposition of this penalty.\u00a0 Moreover, distinguishing such knowledge from an intent to defraud introduces conceptual niceties of questionable value.\u00a0 Hawaii law also recognized both the prima facie evidence of the requisite culpability based upon insufficient funds and failure to correct the insufficiency within five days.[4]\u00a0 The Code attempts to better correlate this offense, both in language and substance, with the civil law relating to negotiable instruments.\n\u00a0\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON \u00a7708-857\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Act 33, Session Laws 1993, amended this section by updating cross references to article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code, which was repealed and replaced by Act 118, Session Laws 1991.\u00a0 House Standing Committee Report No. 513, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1068.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Section construed as permitting but not compelling the inference of guilt under subsection (2)(b).\u00a0 57 H. 526, 560 P.2d 110 (1977).\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7708-857 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 \u00a7708-800.\n\u00a0\n2.\u00a0 Prop.
