[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; am L 1979, c 173, \u00a71; am L 2015, c 35, \u00a726]\n\u00a0\nRevision Note\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 In subsection (1)(b)(i), \"or\" deleted and in subsection (2), paragraph designations deleted, definitions rearranged, and punctuation changed pursuant to \u00a723G-15.\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7708-880\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 This section is an attempt to reinforce civil rules of fidelity by penal sanction.\u00a0 To a lesser degree the section serves another secular function:\u00a0 it helps secure independency of business judgment.\u00a0 The premise is that business decisions ought to be made on merit to insure the optimal allocation of resources: bribery undermines this neutral decision-making process in the same way it undermines public administration.[1]\u00a0 Society's interest in promoting civil or commercial fidelity by penalizing those who intentionally violate those rules and in promoting the proper allocation of resources justifies the imposition of a misdemeanor sanction for this offense.\n\u00a0 Subsection (1)(a) covers bribe offerors in the commercial context.\u00a0 It covers both agents and appraisers.\u00a0 \"Agent\" is defined broadly in subsection (2)(a) to cover all areas where a duty of fidelity is owed.\u00a0 The nature and scope of such duties are defined by common and statutory law regulating or creating the various legal relationships involved.\u00a0 Thus, for example, the duty of an employee to an employer may be not to give away trade secrets, whereas the duty of a fiduciary to the fiduciary's beneficiary or a union representative of an employee's welfare fund to employees may be to exercise independent judgment.\u00a0 \"Appraiser\" is defined broadly in subsection (2)(b) to include, in addition to conventional forms of appraisal, those forms of appraisal that have recently been involved in the \"payola\" scandals; for example, the bribery of disc jockeys, cinema, theatre and music reviewers, and the like, to \"plug\" or give favorable reviews to a certain recording, movie, play, composition, etc.\u00a0 Inherent is an element of \"consumer protection\":\u00a0 we are concerned that the commodity which the appraiser purports to market, that is independence, neutrality, and expertness of judgment, be protected from any undue influences.\n\u00a0 Subsection (1)(b) covers commercial bribe solicitors or receivers.\u00a0 In addition to agents and appraisers, subsection (1)(b)(iii) adds a third category: an agent in charge of employment.\u00a0 The special abuses to which those with power to hire and fire are prone warrant subsection (1)(b)(iii), which sets forth a substantive rule that a benefit shall not be accepted with the intent that some person's status with respect to a job shall be affected thereby, regardless of whether the action constitutes a violation of a duty to a principal.\u00a0 Thus, even though an agent would probably be under a duty to employ the best qualified applicant, acceptance of a benefit from such an applicant should not be allowed.\n\u00a0 Previous Hawaii law recognized no penal offense for bribery in the commercial context.\u00a0 There were provisions affecting bribery of appraisers and arbitrators, but these provisions were clearly concerned with bribery of public or quasi-public officials, rather than with private commercial bribery.[2]\n\u00a0\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON \u00a7708-880\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Act 173, Session Laws 1979, amended subsection (3) to upgrade the offense of commercial bribery to a class C felony in certain instances.\u00a0 The legislature found that the practice of exchanging monetary consideration to influence the discretion of officers in private corporations was perhaps more prevalent and of greater public concern than misdemeanor classification would warrant.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 856.\n\u00a0 Act 35, Session Laws 2015, amended subsection (2) by changing the paragraph designations in the definition of \"agent\" and by making a technical nonsubstantive amendment to the definition of \"appraiser.\"\n__________\n\u00a7708-880 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 Cf. commentary to sections on bribery \u00a7710-1040.\n\u00a0\n2.\u00a0 See H.R.S. \u00a7725-1."
