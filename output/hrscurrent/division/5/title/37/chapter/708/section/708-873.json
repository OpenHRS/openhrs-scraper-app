[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; gen ch 1993]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7708-873\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 The sections dealing with theft are framed in terms of appropriation of property of another; however, a security interest does not make the secured party an owner and the property, by reason of the security interest alone, is not the property of another.[1]\u00a0 It is necessary, therefore, to provide separate penalties for \"debtors or conditional vendees who dispose of property subject to a security interest in ways that may prejudice the secured creditor.\"[2]\u00a0 The requisite culpability is intent to hinder enforcement of the security interest; innocent potential hindering of such interest, such as the temporary removal of a secured chattel from the County or State, ought not to be made subject to criminal sanctions.[3]\n\u00a0 The penalty provided is a misdemeanor, regardless of the amount involved.\u00a0 This differs somewhat from the theft offenses.\u00a0 This difference reflects the fact that generally offenders against a secured interest \"are less dangerously deviated from social norms than outright thieves who take property to which they have no claim.\"[4]\u00a0 Moreover, in those cases where the actor intended, at the time the actor undertook the security obligation, to violate the terms thereof, felony penalties will be available under the theft provisions.[5]\n\u00a0 Previous Hawaii law provided many offenses relating to defrauding secured creditors.\u00a0 These different offenses distinguished between the kind of property involved, i.e., whether real or personal,[6] between the mode of fraud, e.g., whether the property is concealed or sold,[7] and the type of security arrangement involved, e.g., whether a mortgage of personal property or a conditional sale.[8]\u00a0 The exact reason for these various provisions, sometimes with different penalties, seems unclear.\u00a0 The Code provides a single unified offense with a single penalty for conduct which ought to be regarded by the penal law as presenting substantially the same type of social harm.\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7708-873 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 \u00a7708-800.\n\u00a0\n2.\u00a0 M.P.C., Tentative Draft No. 11, comments at 98 (1960).\n\u00a0\n3.\u00a0 Id. at 99.\n\u00a0\n4.\u00a0 Id.\u00a0 It should also be noted that the circumstances which warrant the formulation of a petty misdemeanor theft offense seem generally absent in defrauding secured creditors.\n\u00a0\n5.\u00a0 \u00a7\u00a7708-830 to 833.\n\u00a0\n6.\u00a0 Compare H.R.S. \u00a7745-1 with H.R.S. \u00a7745-2.\n\u00a0\n7.\u00a0 Compare H.R.S. \u00a7745-2 with H.R.S. \u00a7745-3.\n\u00a0\n8.\u00a0 Compare H.R.S. \u00a7745-3 with H.R.S. \u00a7745-7."
