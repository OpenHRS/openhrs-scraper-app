[L 1986, c 314, pt of \u00a761]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7\u00a7708-8100 TO 708-8106\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Act 314, Session Laws 1986, incorporated into the Code the credit card offenses previously included under chapter 851.\u00a0 Apart from this change, credit card offense penalties were made more severe in recognition of the increase in the criminal abuse of credit cards.\u00a0 Also, Act 314 barred the disclosure of credit cardholder lists, except in limited circumstances, because the procurement from stores and credit bureaus of those lists increases the likelihood of credit card fraud and theft.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 820-86, Conference Committee Report No. 51-86.\n\u00a0 Act 55, Session Laws 1988, amended \u00a7708-8100 by lowering the value of money, goods, and services, required as an element of credit card fraud in the class C felony category, from $500 to $300.\u00a0 This amendment makes this section uniform with similar statutory crimes.\u00a0 House Standing Committee Report No. 1173-88.\n\u00a0 Act 287, Session Laws 1993, added \u00a7708-8100.5 to provide criminal sanctions for the fraudulent encoding of a credit card.\u00a0 The legislature found that criminal elements are now capable of changing the magnetic encoding on a credit card to match a usable code and then use the card without detection, resulting in tremendous potential loss to the State's commerce.\u00a0 The legislature further found that because this type of crime is more serious and sophisticated than simple credit card fraud or simple theft and the potential for economic loss is so great, classification of this offense as a class B felony is appropriate.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 102.\n\u00a0 Act 230, Session Laws 2006, amended \u00a7708-8100(2) to provide that each separate use of a stolen credit card that exceeds $300 can be charged as a separate incident.\u00a0 House Standing Committee Report No. 665-06."
