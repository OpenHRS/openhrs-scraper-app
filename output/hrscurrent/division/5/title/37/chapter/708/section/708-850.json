The Act amended this section by adding a definition for \"fraudulently encode magnetic ink character recognition numbers\".\u00a0 The Act also amended this section by adding \"issuing commercial establishment\" to the class of issuers protected from forgery, false making, false completion, false altering, and false endorsement.\n\u00a0 The legislature found that increasingly advanced technology has changed the way in which commercial paper can be handled between parties.\u00a0 One of the technological changes involved the use of magnetic character recognition numbers that enable scanners to quickly obtain information from the document.\u00a0 Changing the magnetic codes effectively tells the scanner different information than that intended, making it a forgery in fact, if not in name.\u00a0 However, that type of document alteration was not currently prohibited by law.\u00a0 The legislature found that the Act would protect parties in that type of situation.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1551, House Standing Committee Report No. 987.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \"Falsely complete\": \u00a0in a prosecution for forgery, the element of completing a check without authority of the ostensible drawer may be proven by circumstantial evidence.\u00a0 79 H. 175 (App.), 900 P.2d 172 (1995)."
