definition of \"deprive\", \"or\" deleted pursuant to \u00a723G-15.\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7708-800\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Section 708-800 provides definitions of terms used repeatedly throughout this chapter; it does not specify any penal offense.\n\u00a0 As with other statutory definitions provided by this Code, a discussion of the definitions when needed or appropriate is found in the commentary on the sections employing the terms defined.\n\u00a0\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON \u00a7708-800\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Act 136, Session Laws 1973, modified the definition of \"building\" and Act 200, Session Laws 1974, further clarified it.\u00a0 As amended in 1974, \"building\" includes any structure, and the term also includes any vehicle, railway car, aircraft, or watercraft used for lodging of persons therein.\n\u00a0 In explaining the change in 1974, the Senate Judiciary Committee in Standing Committee Report No. 1065-74 stated that it was clear the phrase, \"used for lodging of persons therein\" was added by Act 136, Session Laws 1973, \"to modify the terms 'vehicle, railway car, aircraft, or watercraft' and not the word 'structure.'\u00a0 However, it is possible to interpret the present definition as including 'structures' only when 'used for lodging of persons therein.'\u00a0 Such an interpretation means that stores, warehouses, and other commercial buildings not primarily used for the lodging of persons will not be included in the definition of 'building.'\u00a0 As a further result, persons breaking into such places cannot be charged with burglary because the commission of that crime involves breaking into a 'building' as defined in \u00a7708-800(1).\"\n\u00a0 Act 54, Session Laws 1992, amended this section by adding the definition of \"aquaculture product\" for the purpose of protecting Hawaii's aquaculture industry by deterring theft from aquaculture farms, which could cause devastating losses to research facilities and businesses.\u00a0 House Standing Committee Report No. 1184-92, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1671.\n\u00a0 Act 218, Session Laws 1993, amended this section by adding a definition for \"agricultural equipment, supplies, or products.\"\u00a0 The legislature sought to prevent the theft of agricultural equipment, supplies, or products by subjecting violators to a class C felony in \u00a7708-831.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 52.\n\u00a0 Act 287, Session Laws 1993, amended this section by adding a definition for \"encoding.\"\u00a0 The legislature intended to provide criminal sanctions for the fraudulent encoding of a credit card in \u00a7708-8100.5.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 102.\n\u00a0 Act 222, Session Laws 1996, amended this section by adding the definition of \"telecommunication service provider\" and by amending the definitions of \"telecommunication service\" and \"telecommunication service device.\"\u00a0 The Act was intended to expand the scope of the law establishing the offense of telecommunication service fraud, to include fraud involving cellular telephone devices and services.\u00a0 The legislature recognized that cellular telephone fraud had become a major problem in the country, increasing consumer costs, and contributing to increased drug-related criminal activity, and that current state law did not provide comprehensive protection for telecommunication services theft.\u00a0 House Standing Committee Report No. 1521-96, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2017.\n\u00a0 Act 198, Session Laws 1997, expanded the definition of \"credit card\" to include electronic benefit transfer cards and debit cards, in order to criminalize the fraudulent use of debit and electronic benefit transfer cards under part X of chapter 708.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1547.\n\u00a0 Act 45, Session Laws 2002, amended the definition of \"hotel\" to clarify that the definition in relation to offenses against property rights means a structure in which a majority of the tenants are roomers or boarders.\u00a0 The current definition required all tenants to be roomers or boarders.\u00a0 However, hotel structures will rarely be totally occupied by roomers or boarders at the exclusion of commercial tenants such as shops and restaurants.\u00a0 The amended definition would more accurately reflect the current state of hotel operations.\u00a0 House Standing Committee Report No. 176-02, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2461.\n\u00a0 Act 224, Session Laws 2002, amended this section by adding the definition of \"personal information.\"\u00a0 The legislature found that misappropriation of personal identification information was on the rise.\u00a0 Act 224 addresses the criminal conduct associated with intentional identity theft.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 25-02.\n\u00a0 Act 182, Session Laws 2005, amended the definition of \"agricultural equipment, supplies, or products\" by adding agricultural \"commodities\" in the definition.\u00a0 Act 182 addressed the problem of agricultural theft in Hawaii by amending various provisions of Hawaii's theft laws relating to agricultural livestock and products.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 77, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1359.\n\u00a0 Act 139, Session Laws 2006, amended this section by adding the definition of \"confidential personal information.\"\u00a0 Act 139 made it a crime to intentionally or knowingly possess the confidential information of another without that person's authorization.\u00a0 Hawaii law enforcement has found it difficult to curb the rise in identity theft-related crimes when identity thieves in possession of personal information who have not yet caused a monetary loss to the victim cannot be prosecuted for crimes other than petty misdemeanor thefts.\u00a0 The legislature found that amending the law to make intentionally or knowingly possessing the confidential information of another without authorization a class C felony would help to deter identity theft crimes.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2636.\n\u00a0 Act 156, Session Laws 2006, amended this section by adding the definition of \"aquacultural equipment, supplies, or products.\"\u00a0 Act 156 established intentionally or knowingly damaging the agricultural or aquacultural equipment, supplies, or products of another as an offense of criminal property damage.\u00a0 The legislature found that increasing the penalties for criminal property damage offenses was consistent with the great impact these crimes have on Hawaii's agricultural and aquacultural industries and the ability of individual farmers and ranchers to earn a living.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report Nos. 3021 and 3310.\n\u00a0 Act 181, Session Laws 2006, amended the definition of \"widely dangerous means\" by excluding \"fire\" from the definition.\u00a0 Act 181 included arson as a new class of property damage and defined four degrees of the offense of arson with appropriate sanctions. The legislature found that fires that are intentionally set cause extensive damage to public and private properties and threaten lives.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 50-06.\n\u00a0 Act 208, Session Laws 2011, amended the definition of \"enter or remain unlawfully\" by deleting the provision that a person who enters or remains on unimproved and apparently unused land that is not fenced or otherwise enclosed in a manner designed to exclude intruders, unless notice against trespass has been given, is allowed to be on the land and is not trespassing.\u00a0 The legislature recognized that, in many cases, trespassers are armed and found many miles from the nearest town or police station, and that in these situations, personal notice is impractical and even dangerous.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1254, Conference Committee Report No. 59.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Defendant did not intend to permanently deprive car dealership of vehicle where evidence indicated defendant wanted to have new vehicle to drive for weekend then return it when defendant's deception was discovered.\u00a0 86 H. 207, 948 P.2d 1048 (1997).\n\u00a0 Where defendant returned new vehicle after 72 hour possession and prosecution was unable to prove any economic loss to car dealership, no intent to deprive dealership of significant portion of vehicle's economic value, use, or benefit.\u00a0 86 H. 207, 948 P.2d 1048 (1997).\n\u00a0 Inasmuch as the \"intent to defraud\" component of second degree theft by shoplifting, as defined by this section, prescribes two alternative means of establishing the state of mind requisite to the offense of second degree theft by shoplifting, trial court plainly erred in failing to instruct jury as to the alternative states of mind requisite to the charged offense.\u00a0 101 H. 389, 69 P.3d 517 (2003).\n\u00a0 The alternative states of mind potentially requisite to the charged offense of second degree theft by shoplifting, as prescribed by the definition of \"intent to defraud\" set forth in this section, does not implicate a defendant's constitutional right to a unanimous jury verdict, as guaranteed by article I, \u00a7\u00a75 and 14 of the Hawaii constitution; a proper elements instruction, which sets forth the alternative states of mind prescribed by the \"intent to defraud\" component of second degree theft by shoplifting, does not violate defendant's constitutional right.\u00a0 101 H. 389, 69 P.3d 517 (2003).\n\u00a0 Where petitioner was charged with theft by deception in a situation involving a contract, the intent element of the crime was not met where evidence showed that petitioner performed or intended to perform petitioner's part of the contract; intent element would have only been satisfied if the petitioner intended not to perform petitioner's contractual obligations; further, subsequent breach of the contract may give rise to potential civil remedies grounded in contract law, but unless accompanied by the intent to deprive a complainant's property, the breach does not create criminal liability for theft.\u00a0 129 H. 414, 301 P.3d 1255 (2013).\n\u00a0 Shambles and temporary absence not abandonment sufficient to deprive structure of use as a dwelling; a structure, although unoccupied does not become abandoned unless it is \"wholly forsaken or deserted\"; unoccupied house does not cease to be a \"dwelling\" because of the temporary absence of the owner.\u00a0 2 H. App. 581, 637 P.2d 782 (1981).\n\u00a0 Nightclub owner's bedroom and bath in separately secured area of club constituted a \"building\" within the meaning of this section.\u00a0 9 H. App. 307, 837 P.2d 1308 (1992).\n\u00a0 Once erected, a tent is a structure, and thus, a building.\u00a0 9 H. App. 368, 842 P.2d 267 (1992).\n\u00a0 In prosecution for first degree burglary under \u00a7708-810, prosecution satisfied its burden of proving that storage shed was in a garage that was part of a building that was a dwelling.\u00a0 86 H. 143 (App.), 948 P.2d 564 (1997)."
