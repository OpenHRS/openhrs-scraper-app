[L 1973, c 72, pt of \u00a72; am L 1977, c 27, \u00a72]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7\u00a7708-838 AND 708-839\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Act 72, Session Laws 1973, added these two new sections to the Code.\u00a0 These sections prohibit the defacing, removal, or alteration of any factory or owner identification mark or serial number from any merchandise on which the same has been inscribed or marked, and thereby provide more effective protection to the public from theft and traffic of stolen merchandise.\n\u00a0 The Senate Consumer Protection Committee in Standing Committee Report No. 802 stated:\n\u00a0 Police are hampered many times in their efforts to identify and recover stolen merchandise because the serial numbers or the identification marks are removed or obliterated.\u00a0 These marks are removed to frustrate the police and so that the thieves can resell the items.\u00a0 The resale of untraceable firearms is a practice which directly contributes to violent crimes in the community.\n\u00a0\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON \u00a7\u00a7708-838 AND 708-839\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Act 27, Session Laws 1977, amended these sections to provide for two classes of identification marks--those placed by manufacturers and those affixed by others--and to differentiate the mental aspect required for the imposition of liability as to each class.\u00a0 Section 708-838, as amended, thus seeks to impose liability for altering manufacturer's marks without requiring any specific intent.\u00a0 But for altering other marks, it requires acting \"knowingly, to conceal the true ownership of the property of another.\"\u00a0 Similarly \u00a7708-839, as now amended, intends to impose liability for the mere possession of the merchandise where merchandise with altered manufacturer's marks are involved, but to require possession with knowledge of the alteration where other marks are concerned.\u00a0 House Standing Committee Report No. 873.\n\u00a0 In addition, Act 27 deleted all references to firearms from these sections, the offense of removing identification marks from firearms being covered by \u00a7134-10."
