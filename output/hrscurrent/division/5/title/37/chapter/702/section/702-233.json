[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7702-233\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 This section states the general view that the victim's consent to the defendant's conduct, or to the result of the defendant's conduct, is a defense if it negatives an element of the offense (e.g., consent to sexual intercourse on charge of rape) or precludes the harm or evil sought to be prevented by the law defining the offense (e.g., consent by the victim to allow the defendant to demonstrate a wrestling hold or maneuver upon the victim).\u00a0 It is obvious that this general principle should not be extended to all types of evils or harms and therefore this section is intended to be read in conjunction with \u00a7702-234 (consent to bodily injury) and \u00a7702-235 (ineffective consent).\n\u00a0 Although this general principle has not been previously codified in Hawaii, it has been impliedly recognized.[1]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Based on the facts and the charged offenses in the case, the alternative theories of absence of consent and ineffective consent did not represent separate crimes; rather, they were alternative means of proving the attendant circumstance element of a single crime.\u00a0 96 H. 161, 29 P.3d 351 (2001).\n\u00a0 In sexual assault case, jury instruction as to ineffective consent prejudicially affected defendant's rights to due process because (1) jury was instructed that it could convict defendant based on the absence of consent under this section or any of the four grounds of ineffective consent under \u00a7702-235, (2) there was a reasonable possibility that the verdict was based on at least one of the four grounds of ineffective consent, and (3) there was legally insufficient evidence to support any of the four grounds of ineffective consent presented to the jury.\u00a0 96 H. 161, 29 P.3d 351 (2001).\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7702-233 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 Territory v. Lee, 29 Haw. 30 (1926) (where a bank teller mistakenly paid out too much money on a check, it was held that the teller's mistake was not \"consent\" to the taking which would afford a defense to a charge of larceny)."
