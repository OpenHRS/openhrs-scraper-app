[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; gen ch 1993]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7702-223\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 This section is intended to make clear that a defendant charged, on the basis of the defendant's complicity in the conduct of another, with causing a particular result will not be allowed to escape accountability for the result because the defendant solicited or aided, etc., a different or more limited result if the defendant had the requisite state of mind with respect to the actual result.\n\u00a0 Thus, for example, one who urges a driver to increase the speed of an automobile, disregarding known risks to pedestrians, would stand in the same position as the driver on a charge of reckless homicide and would not be allowed to defend on the ground that one solicited the violation of the traffic law and not the homicide law.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Instruction on law of principals and accomplices was not erroneous.\u00a0 59 H. 625, 586 P.2d 250 (1978).\n\u00a0 Accomplice in commission of robbery.\u00a0 62 H. 25, 608 P.2d 855 (1980)."
