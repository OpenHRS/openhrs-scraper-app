[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7702-210\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Many regulatory penal offenses appear in statutes other than the Penal Code.\u00a0 These regulatory statutes often employ different words to designate the state of mind or culpability requirement needed to establish various regulatory offenses.\u00a0 In this respect the penal statutes dealing with regulatory offenses are much the same as those appearing in the previous Title on crimes.[1]\u00a0 While no attempt will be made to correlate the present culpability requirements of regulatory offenses with the four states of mind which the Code recognizes as sufficient to establish culpability with respect to the elements of an offense, an exception is made for the word \"wilful\" or \"wilfully.\"\n\u00a0 That term is used pervasively in penal statutes to describe the requisite culpability or state of mind.\u00a0 However, the phrase has been defined differently in similar contexts.\u00a0 For example, it has been held that the felony of wilfully failing to account for and to pay over tax monies requires \"bad purpose and evil motive,\" whereas, the misdemeanor of wilfully failing to file an income tax return requires that the defendant acted \"with bad purpose or without grounds for believing that one's act is lawful or without reasonable cause, or capriciously or with careless disregard whether one has the right to so act.\"[2]\u00a0 With respect to the same misdemeanor, it has been said that \"[m]ere voluntary and purposeful, as distinguished from accidental, omission to make timely return might meet the test of wilfulness.\"[3]\n\u00a0 In a Hawaii case, involving a disputed labor contract, the court, in discussing the penal remedies afforded to the employer by then existing law, said that a wilful absence was \"one without sufficient legal excuse\"[4]--a rather transparent definition at best.\n\u00a0 To eliminate distinctions of this type, the Code equates acting wilfully with acting knowingly.\u00a0 This equation reaches a result in accord with most decisions.\u00a0 The Code recognizes, however, that in some situations the courts have construed \"wilful\" to impose an additional requirement of culpability.\u00a0 In such situations the \"perception of such a ... [legislative] purpose [to impose additional culpability requirements] normally derives, of course, from judicial appraisal of the consequences of the enactment if its scope is not limited by construction.\"[5]\u00a0 To allow for situations of this kind, the final clause provides that the section is not applicable if a purpose to impose further culpability requirements appears.\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7702-210 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 Cf.
