[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; am L 1975, c 163, \u00a71; gen ch 1993]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7702-215\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 As indicated in the commentary to \u00a7702-214 this section departs from the common-law concept of \"proximate cause\" (at best a poor label for a host of largely unarticulated considerations) and analyzes the question of whether a defendant will be held liable for having caused a particular result not in terms of factual or \"scientific\" causation (which has to be resolved according to the test set forth in \u00a7702-214) but in terms of those factors which properly bear on the defendant's culpability with respect to a result other than one which the defendant intended or contemplated.\u00a0 The factors to be considered are, as stated, whether the actual result is more serious or extensive than the intended or contemplated result and whether the actual result is too remote or accidental in its occurrence or too dependent on another's volitional conduct to have a bearing on defendant's liability (or the gravity of the defendant's offense).\n\u00a0 The Code follows the Model Penal Code[1] as supplemented by the suggestion of Hart and Honore that provisions regarding liability for unintended or uncontemplated results must be separately stated for those instances when the difference in result is due to natural events and those instances when it is due to the volitional conduct of another.[2]\u00a0 Although the commentary to the Model Penal Code would suggest that volitional conduct of another is adequately covered as a factor which might make the actual result \"too remote or accidental,\" greater clarity is achieved by the language of this Code.\n\u00a0\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON \u00a7702-215\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Act 163, Session Laws 1975, amended this section in order to phrase the propositions in positive rather than negative language.\u00a0 It was felt that this change would make these propositions clearer when included in jury instructions.\u00a0 This amendment was not intended to change the section in substance but only in form.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 19.\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7702-215 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 M.P.C. \u00a72.03(2).\n\u00a0\n2.\u00a0 Hart & Honore, Causation in the Law 357 (1959)."
