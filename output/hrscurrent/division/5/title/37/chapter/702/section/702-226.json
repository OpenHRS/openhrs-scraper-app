[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; gen ch 1993]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7702-226\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 This section provides that when, by reason of accountability for conduct, two or more defendants are liable for the same offense, which is divided into degrees, each defendant shall be convicted of the degree which is consistent with the defendant's own state of mind or mental culpability and the defendant's own accountability for aggravating facts and circumstances.\n\u00a0 This section is a sorely-needed correction of Hawaii law which has been interpreted to require, in the case of an accomplice, not only that the defendant stand in the same shoes as the person for whose conduct the defendant is accountable, but that the defendant be held to think the same thoughts.[1]\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7702-226 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 See State v. Shon, 47 Haw. 158, 385 P.2d 830 (1963), interpreting \u00a7252-4 R.L.H. (1955), subsequently H.R.S. \u00a7704-4."
