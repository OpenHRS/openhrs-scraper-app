[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nRevision Note\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Numeric designations deleted and definitions rearranged pursuant to \u00a723G-15.\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7702-229\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 It seems clear that, in dealing with corporate penal liability, government corporations must be exempt.\u00a0 Penal liability in such a case is pointless.\n\u00a0 The phrases \"agent\" and \"high managerial agent\" are broadly and inclusively defined.\u00a0 Given the wide variety of employment and other agency relationships, the definitions must present criteria which are very general.\u00a0 Further refinement or elaboration should be left to a case-by-case determination."
