[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nCross References\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Disposition of convicted defendants, see chapter 706.\n\u00a0 Grades and classes of offenses, see \u00a7701-107.\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7702-213\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 As explained in prior commentary, the Code takes the position that penal law is primarily concerned with the culpable commission of offenses.\u00a0 Absent a minimal degree of culpability - i.e., negligence as defined in the Code - the penal law should not impose sanctions (e.g., imprisonment) which import moral condemnation.\u00a0 In such situations \"the law has neither a deterrent nor corrective nor an incapacitative function to perform.\"[1]\u00a0 Accordingly, \u00a7702-204 requires, subject to \u00a7702-212, culpability with respect to the elements of penal offenses.\u00a0 Section 702-212 provides that the culpability provisions are not applicable to violations - the lowest grade of penal offense - which result in a fine, forfeiture or other \"civil\" penalty, but not in imprisonment or its equivalent.\u00a0 Because of the limited scope of the Penal Code and because of the pervasive use of penal sanction in regulatory statutes, \u00a7702-212 also provides that the culpability requirements are not applicable to offenses defined by statutes other than the Penal Code when a legislative purpose to impose absolute liability plainly appears.\n\u00a0 Section 702-213 is a necessary concomitant to \u00a7702-212(2).\u00a0 It provides that, with the limited exception of \u00a7702-212(2), when absolute liability is imposed by a statute other than the Penal Code, the offense shall constitute a violation and not a crime.\u00a0 Subsection (1) of this section thus superimposes, as far as possible, the standards of the Penal Code on all penal statutes.\n\u00a0 Subsection (2) provides, on the other hand, that, with respect to penal statutes outside the Code, although absolute liability is imposed, reducing the offenses to the status of a violation, the culpable commission of such offenses may be charged and proved.\u00a0 In such cases, the reduction of the offense to a violation does not occur.\u00a0 Negligence is treated as sufficient culpability in cases of this kind.\u00a0 Since most penal statutes which are not a part of the Penal Code are regulatory legislation, providing that a criminal conviction may be based on negligence does not seem overly severe given the aims of such legislation.\n\u00a0\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON \u00a7702-213\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Part V of chapter 707 of the Code, dealing with sex offenses, should be reviewed in light of \u00a7702-213 to determine whether the legislature, in not requiring knowledge on the actor's part of the victim's age (when age is a relevant attendant circumstance), intended to create an exception to the general principle enunciated in this section.\u00a0 (Cf. Supplemental Commentary on \u00a7702-204.)\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7702-213 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 M.P.C., Tentative Draft No. 4, comments at 140 (1955)."
