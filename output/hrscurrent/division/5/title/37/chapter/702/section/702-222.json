[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; gen ch 1993]\n\u00a0\nRevision Note\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 In paragraph (1)(a), \"or\" deleted pursuant to \u00a723G-15.\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7702-222\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 This section sets forth the types and extent of complicity in the penal conduct of another.\u00a0 In subsection (1) the Code sets forth the state of mind that is required--\"intention of promoting or facilitating the commission of the offense\"--and the nature of action or omission on the part of the defendant which is sufficient to establish complicity in and liability for the conduct of another.\u00a0 The Code avoids the vague concept of conspiracy in basing penal liability on the conduct of another, and focuses instead on the conduct of the accused which is sufficient to establish the accused's complicity.\n\u00a0 The Code includes solicitation, aid, agreement and attempt to aid, and the failure to make a proper effort to exercise a legal duty to prevent commission of the offense.\u00a0 Since the intent to promote or facilitate the commission of the offense is present, there is no risk of innocence.\u00a0 Given the intent specified, the inclusion of attempts to aid seems entirely proper.\u00a0 Acquittal should not be had upon a showing of ineffective aid.\u00a0 \"Where complicity is based upon agreement or encouragement, one does not ask for evidence that they were actually operative psychologically on the person who committed the offense; there ought to be no difference in the case of aid.\"[1]\n\u00a0 It should be pointed out that approval of the conduct of another is not to be implied from the phrase \"with intention of promoting or facilitating the commission of the offense.\"\u00a0 For example, a landlord who leases premises with intent to facilitate another's establishing an illegal gambling casino or narcotics den would be liable regardless of the landlord's personal predilections.\n\u00a0 Subsection (2) preserves the concept that special legislation may declare specific conduct of the accused sufficient to establish the accused's complicity in the conduct of another.\u00a0 Such legislation is an analogue to that declaring particular acts of assistance independent offenses.\u00a0 Thus, for example, being a member of a mob may suffice to establish complicity in a riot or looting or lynching.\n\u00a0 Previous Hawaii law on complicity was more simplified and \"modern\" than that found in most states which have not undertaken a recent revision of their penal laws, and to a substantial degree was similar in effect to the Code provision.\u00a0 However, the prior statute did draw distinctions based on (1) presence at the offense (which has been liberally interpreted), and (2) participation (as opposed to aid, command, or encouragement).[2]\u00a0 These verbal distinctions, however, were apparently without legal consequence; under the prior statute every person who aids in the commission of a crime or who \"abets..., procures, counsels, incites, commands or hires another to commit the same\"[3] \"is guilty of such offense.\"[4]\u00a0 Although the statutory law did not resort to the term \"conspiracy\" to establish complicity, the court has.[5]\u00a0 This should be avoided because in some instances, where the chain of conspirators has become attenuated, imposition of liability, on the basis of complicity, for acts of remote conspirators might be of questionable wisdom.\n\u00a0 Subsections (1)(a) and (1)(b) rationalize the prior law, delete archaic phrases, and achieve greater clarity.\u00a0 Subsection (1)(c), which establishes complicity for failure to exercise a legal duty to prevent the offense, is an addition to the law.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Evidence held sufficient to prove defendant was an accomplice in the commission of burglary.\u00a0 58 H. 404, 570 P.2d 844 (1977).\n\u00a0 Instruction on law of principals and accomplices was not erroneous.\u00a0 59 H. 625, 586 P.2d 250 (1978).\n\u00a0 Statute provides for liability where an accomplice simply aids the perpetrator in committing an offense.\u00a0 61 H. 475, 605 P.2d 75 (1980).\n\u00a0 Accomplice jury instruction did not contain mens rea element.\u00a0 72 H. 278, 815 P.2d 428 (1991).\n\u00a0 Where defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to prove defendant was an accomplice to an assault in any degree, and evidence was adduced that defendant pushed a person who was involved in a motor vehicle accident, causing the person to fall to the ground, and defendant held the person on the ground before the driver of a car involved in the accident jumped onto the person, substantial evidence supported the jury's conclusion.\u00a0 132 H. 97, 319 P.3d 1105 (2014).\n\u00a0 Plain language of section imposes no requirement that a joint legal duty exist before accomplice liability is imposed.\u00a0 10 H.
