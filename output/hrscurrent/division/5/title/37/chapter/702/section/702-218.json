[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7702-218\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 [Section 218, as contained in the Proposed Draft of the Code provided that ignorance or mistake of fact or law was a defense under the conditions stated above.\u00a0 The following commentary is based on this initial proposal for \u00a7218.]\n\u00a0 This section states the logical concomitant of the requirement that to establish each element of an offense a certain state of mind with respect thereto must be proven.\u00a0 Thus, if a person is ignorant or mistaken as to a matter of fact or law, the person's ignorance or mistake will, in appropriate circumstances, prevent the person from having the requisite culpability with respect to the fact or law as it actually exists.\u00a0 For example, a person who is mistaken (either reasonably, negligently, or recklessly) as to which one of a number of similar umbrellas on a rack is the person's and who takes another's umbrella should be afforded a defense to a charge of theft predicated on either intentionally or knowingly taking the property of another.\u00a0 Also, a person, mistaken as to the effect of a divorce decree erroneously purporting to sever the marital ties of his wife, who marries another woman should not be convicted of bigamy if bigamy requires knowledge by the defendant of the defendant's existing marital status.\u00a0 A reckless mistake would afford a defense to a charge requiring intent or knowledge--but not to an offense which required only recklessness or negligence.\u00a0 Similarly, a negligent mistake would afford a defense to a charge predicated on intent, knowledge, or recklessness--but not to an offense based on negligence.\n\u00a0 This section of the Code deals with ignorance or mistake of fact or law, but it is not intended to deal with the limited problem of the defense afforded a person who engaged in conduct under the mistaken belief that the conduct itself was not legally prohibited.\u00a0 That problem is dealt with exclusively by \u00a7702-220.\n\u00a0 Previous Hawaii law recognized a defense based on ignorance or mistake of fact[1] or law,[2] but usually the law required that the ignorance or mistake be reasonable.[3]\u00a0 The Code correlates the culpability required for commission of the offense with the culpability which will deprive ignorance or mistake of effect as a defense.\n\u00a0\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON \u00a7702-218\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 The legislature in dealing with \u00a7702-218 deleted a defense based on mistake of law.\u00a0 The legislature said that it was \"thereby avoiding a major dilemma with respect to enforcement of the provisions of this Code.\u00a0 The defenses of ignorance of the law afforded by \u00a7\u00a7702-218 and 220 would have been available, to a degree, under any given set of circumstances and as such would have constituted a major encumbrance to enforcement of the substance and spirit of the Code.\"\u00a0 See Conference Committee Report No. 2 (1972).\n\u00a0 Although the legislature did not provide for a defense based on mistake of law, the State Supreme Court has recognized that, in some instances, there must exist, as a necessary corollary to the definition to certain offenses, a defense based on this type of mistake.\u00a0 See State v. Marley, 54 Haw. 450, 476-477, 509 P.2d 1095, 1111-1112 (1973).\u00a0 The court cited \u00a7702-220 of the Hawaii Penal Code as providing a defense to a state trespass prosecution in the case of honest and reasonable belief (\"no matter how incorrect such a belief might be\") that another law (American treaty law) afforded a defense to the trespass.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Where a defendant has adduced evidence at trial supporting an instruction on the statutory defense of ignorance or mistake of fact, the trial court must, at the defendant's request, separately instruct as to the defense, notwithstanding that the trial court has also instructed regarding the state of mind requisite to the charged offense.\u00a0 100 H. 195, 58 P.3d 1242 (2002).\n\u00a0 Trial courts must specifically instruct juries, where the record so warrants, that the burden is upon the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was not ignorant or mistaken as to a fact that negates the state of mind required to establish an element of the charged offense or offenses.\u00a0 107 H. 239, 112 P.3d 725 (2005).\n\u00a0 Because \u00a7708-836 does not \"plainly appear\" to render its specified state of mind inapplicable to the authorization element, the intentional or knowing states of mind apply to the authorization element; thus, a defendant prosecuted under \u00a7708-836 may assert the mistake-of-fact defense under this section with respect to the authorization element, where defendant claims that defendant mistakenly believed that the person who authorized defendant's operation of the vehicle was the vehicle's registered owner, because such a belief would potentially negative the state of mind required to establish the authorization element of the offense.\u00a0 117 H. 235, 178 P.3d 1 (2008).\n\u00a0 Where, based on the evidence presented, petitioner provided some basis for the jury to believe that (1) petitioner was mistaken as to the reporting requirements associated with receiving public assistance and/or (2) petitioner was mistaken as to certain factual matters regarding petitioner's personal situation which caused petitioner to misreport, there was a reasonable possibility that the jury, if provided with a separate mistake of fact instruction, could have found that petitioner did not knowingly deceive the human services department; thus appellate court erred in concluding that petitioner was not entitled to a mistake of fact instruction.\u00a0\u00a0 122 H. 271, 226 P.3d 441 (2010).\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7702-218 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 The King v. Grieve, 6 Haw. 740 (1883) (ignorance of Hawaiian language precluded \"knowing\" publication in that language); Territory v. Hall, 17 Haw. 536 (1906).\n\u00a0\n2.\u00a0 Territory v. Lo Kam, 13 Haw. 14 (1900) (mistake as to lawful authority to remain on premises was a defense to a charge of vagrancy).\n\u00a0\n3.\u00a0 Territory v. Hall, supra; State v. Dizon, 47 Haw. 444, 461, 390 P.2d 759, 769 (1964)."
