[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; am L 1973, c 136, \u00a73(a); am L 1975, c 163, \u00a72; gen ch 1993]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7702-216\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Much of what has been said in the commentary on \u00a7\u00a7702-214 and 215 applies with equal force to this section.\u00a0 The only difference is that this section deals with reckless and negligent causation.\u00a0 Here the Code is concerned with results which differ from those within the risk of which the defendant was aware or of which the defendant should have been aware.\u00a0 However, the factors which are to be considered are the same:\u00a0 whether the actual harm is more extensive or serious than the probable result and whether the actual result is too remote or accidental in its occurrence or too dependent on another's volitional conduct.\u00a0 For a fuller discussion, the reader is referred to the commentary on \u00a7\u00a7702-214 and 215.\n\u00a0\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON \u00a7702-216\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Act 136, Session Laws 1973, amended paragraph (1) by deleting the words \"intended or contemplated\" which followed the word \"harm\" and amended paragraph (2) by substituting the phrase \"probable result\" for the phrase \"intended or contemplated result.\"\u00a0 References to the words \"intended or contemplated\" were eliminated since they \"connote an intentional act on the part of the accused which is inconsistent with 'reckless' or 'negligent' as defined in \u00a7702-206.\"\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 858, House Standing Committee Report No. 726.\n\u00a0 Act 163, Session Laws 1975, amended this section in order to phrase the propositions in positive rather than negative language.\u00a0 It was felt that this change would make these propositions clearer when included in jury instructions.\u00a0 This amendment was not intended to change the section in substance but only in form.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 19."
