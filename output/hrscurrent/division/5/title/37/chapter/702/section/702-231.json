[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; am L 1979, c 183, \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7702-231\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 A narrow defense is provided in this section for the defendant who claims that the defendant's conduct resulted not from the defendant's own culpability but rather from coercion exercised upon the defendant by a third party.\u00a0 It cannot be said that the defendant's conduct is not \"voluntary\" as that term is used in the penal law, because the defendant's conduct does result from the defendant's conscious determination.\u00a0 Rather, the basis for permitting the defense is the rationale that the penal law ought not to condemn that which most persons would do in similar circumstances.\n\u00a0 The defendant is afforded by this section an affirmative defense if the defendant engaged in the conduct or caused the result alleged because of the use or threatened use of unlawful force against the defendant or another and a person of reasonable firmness would have been unable to resist such duress.\u00a0 Although the \"reasonable man\" standard is employed in a limited manner, the Code has not invoked a negligence standard for penal liability in all cases of duress.\u00a0 The conscious decision to yield in a duress situation is distinguishable from the inadvertent disregard of unknown risks in the case of negligence.\n\u00a0 Subsection (2) makes the defense unavailable if the defendant was culpable in placing the defendant in the position where the defendant would be subject to duress.\n\u00a0 Subsection (3) abolishes the common-law presumption of coercion when a woman commits an offense under the direction of her husband.\u00a0 The defense is still available to the wife provided she can raise and prove the issue by evidence.\n\u00a0 The prior law on this subject, H.R.S. \u00a7703-5 (as compiled prior to this Code), provided that a defendant will not be regarded as responsible for an act \"to the doing of which he is compelled by force which he cannot resist, or from which he cannot escape\" if the threatened or imminent danger is greater than that inflicted by the defendant.\u00a0 (Emphasis added.)\n\u00a0\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON \u00a7702-231\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Act 183, Session Laws 1979, added subsection (5) which expressly categorizes duress as an affirmative defense.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 883 states:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If any class of defenses deserves the title of \"affirmative,\" it is those defenses that admit the commission of the act charged with the necessary mental element, but seek to interpose the existence of facts that, if true, would provide a complete exculpation.\u00a0 The traditional defenses of duress, necessity and self-defense are common examples.\u00a0 Unless one is willing to draw the concepts of volitional act and mental element quite broadly, these defenses do not negate either concept.\u00a0 In that respect they are analogous to the common law of confession and avoidance; they admit the truth of the facts pleaded but offer an excuse.\u00a0 36 Ohio State Law Journal 828 at 840-41.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Accomplice's testimony regarding other accomplice's prior bad acts was not relevant to defendant's claim of duress and was, therefore, inadmissible under HRE rule 402.\u00a0 101 H. 269, 67 P.3d 768 (2003).\n\u00a0 In a prosecution for prostitution, where defendant did not testify to any use or threat of use of unlawful force against defendant's person, and defendant acknowledged that officer did not block defendant's exit and defendant did not attempt to leave the hotel room, it could not be said that the trial court's finding that defendant failed to establish duress by a preponderance of the evidence was erroneous.\u00a0 114 H. 1, 155 P.3d 1102 (2007).\n\u00a0 The choice of evils defense under \u00a7703-302 and the duress defense under this section are not, as a matter of statutory law, inconsistent.\u00a0 93 H. 399 (App.), 4 P.3d 533 (2000)."
