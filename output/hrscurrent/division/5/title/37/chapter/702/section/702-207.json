[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7702-207\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 This section makes it clear that the specified state of mind requirement applies to all elements of an offense.\u00a0 This resolves a latent ambiguity found in many penal statutes.\u00a0 If, for example, a statute were to make it an offense to intentionally or knowingly break and enter the dwelling of another, it is probably clear that the specified state of mind applies to entering as well as breaking, however it should also be made clear that it applies to the attendant circumstances \"dwelling of another.\"\n\u00a0 The phrase \"unless a contrary purpose plainly appears\" is intended to allow the courts to avoid an improper result when the language of a statute fails to indicate that the specified state of mind applies to less than all elements and legislative history indicates that this was intended.\n\u00a0 Prior Hawaii law did not recognize the principle that culpability must be proven as to each element of an offense.\u00a0 This stems in part from the fact that the concept of \"elements of an offense\" had not been fully explored.\u00a0 A case involving a charge of contributing to the delinquency of a minor stated by way of dictum that culpability with respect to the age of the victim did not have to be proven.[1]\u00a0 To the extent that this section modifies the previous law, it merely rejects those few instances where absolute penal liability was imposed indirectly.\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7702-207 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 Territory v.
