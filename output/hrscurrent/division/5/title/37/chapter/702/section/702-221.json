[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nRevision Note\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 In subsection (2)(a), \"or\" deleted pursuant to \u00a723G-15.\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7702-221\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Subsection (1) of this section states the general principle that penal liability, in the first analysis, rests on conduct; the conduct in most instances is that of the accused but, as the Code states, the relevant conduct may be that of a person for whose conduct the accused is legally accountable.\u00a0 Distinctions between principals and accessories are dispensed with and a defendant may be convicted directly of an offense committed by another for whose conduct the defendant is accountable.\n\u00a0 Subsection (2) states those instances when a defendant will be held legally accountable for another's conduct.\n\u00a0 Subsection (2)(a) deals with the problem of the innocent or irresponsible agent.\u00a0 When the defendant intentionally or knowingly causes an innocent person to engage in prohibited conduct, there is little difficulty in holding the defendant accountable for such conduct.\u00a0 Where the commission of an offense requires recklessness or negligence on the part of the defendant, it is sufficient that the defendant recklessly or negligently caused an innocent or irresponsible person to engage in the conduct prohibited by the offense.\u00a0 In short, the Code couples the state of mind of the defendant with the conduct the defendant has caused another to perform and determines the defendant's liability accordingly.\n\u00a0 Subsection (2)(b) is intended to leave undisturbed those pieces of legislation either within or outside of this Code which impose a special measure of accountability for the behavior of another.\u00a0 This type of legislation usually involves the liability of a principal for acts of an agent.\u00a0 Thus, for example, the legislature may deem it appropriate to impose on a liquor licensee an absolute duty not to sell liquor to a minor.\u00a0 If the duty is nondelegable, a sale by an employee would result in the licensee's penal liability.\u00a0 Similarly, where strict liability is imposed it is \"no more unjust to hold the innocent master than his innocent servant, acting in the course of his employment.\"[1]\n\u00a0 Subsection (2)(b) does not support the concept of strict penal liability.\u00a0 As this chapter makes clear, such liability is rejected as a matter of general principle.\u00a0 However, in extraordinary cases, especially in the regulatory area, the legislature may deem such liability necessary.\u00a0 Subsection (2)(b) is intended only to accommodate that determination.\n\u00a0 Subsection (2)(c) provides for legal accountability for penal complicity.\u00a0 The term \"accomplice\" is developed in following sections.\u00a0 Prior Hawaii law did not deal with the problem posed by subsection (2)(a).\u00a0 The court has held that a breach of a legal duty by an employee renders the master liable.\u00a0 The court said:\u00a0 \"The delegation of the duty of supervising [publication of a newspaper], by the master to the servant, does not free the master.\u00a0 He is to be holden for the neglect or indiscretion of the servant.\"[2]\u00a0 What the court in effect did was to make the duty nondelegable by case law.\u00a0 Subsection (2)(b) would recognize such decisions if predicated on legislation which either specifically or by construction imposed this measure of accountability.\u00a0 The subsection would also cover accountability based on strict penal liability.\u00a0 The previous Hawaii provisions with respect to complicity, as they related to subsection (2)(c) and following sections, are explained in the commentary on following sections.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Instruction on law of principals and accomplices was not erroneous.\u00a0 59 H. 625, 586 P.2d 250 (1978).\n\u00a0 Liability as accomplice in commission of sexual abuse.\u00a0 61 H. 475, 605 P.2d 75 (1980).\n\u00a0 Officer had probable cause to believe defendant was an accomplice where: \u00a0(1) car's license plate and \"punched\" ignition were located in such places that would suggest defendant knew vehicle was stolen; and (2) defendant and car driver were parked at a house whose owner knew defendant but not the driver, suggesting that defendant assisted in the decision to park at the house, thereby aiding or attempting to aid driver's commission of an unauthorized control of a propelled vehicle (UCPV) violation; thus evidence was sufficient to provide more than a mere suspicion that defendant committed the offense of UCPV either as a principal or accomplice.\u00a0 109 H. 84, 123 P.3d 679 (2005).\n\u00a0 Cited:\u00a0 9 H. App. 551, 851 P.2d 926 (1993).\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7702-221 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 M.P.C., Tentative Draft No. 1, comments at 19 (1953).\n\u00a0\n2.\u00a0 In re Lyons, 6 Haw. 452, 454 (1884)."
