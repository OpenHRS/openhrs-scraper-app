[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; gen ch 1993]\n\u00a0\nRevision Note\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 In paragraph (1), \"or\" deleted pursuant to \u00a723G-15.\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7702-225\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 This section deals with certain defenses which will not be allowed in any case in which the liability of the defendant is based on the defendant's accountability for the conduct of another.\n\u00a0 Subsection (1) deals with the limited problem posed by a person who cannot commit a particular offense in the person's individual capacity but who is accountable for conduct of another who engages in the prohibited conduct.\u00a0 The Code resolves the problem by providing for liability notwithstanding lack of individual capacity.\u00a0 Thus, for example, a woman cannot commit rape in her individual capacity, but she may nevertheless be guilty of that crime if she assists a man to commit rape upon another woman.\n\u00a0 Subsection (2) eliminates the common-law defense based on lack of conviction of the person upon whose conduct the penal liability of the defendant is predicated.\u00a0 The absence of this defense does not, of course, relieve the prosecution of the requirement of proving that the offense was actually committed and the defendant's complicity therein.\n\u00a0 Subsection (3) provides that, in the extremely rare case, where the person upon whose conduct the liability of the defendant is predicated has a legal immunity from prosecution, the defendant will not be afforded a defense on that ground.\n\u00a0 Hawaii case law has recognized, by way of dictum, the principle in subsection (1).[1]\u00a0 The Supreme Court sidestepped an opportunity to rule on the issue resolved by subsection (2).[2]\u00a0 Subsection (3) is an addition to the law.\u00a0 No case has been found dealing with the effect of immunity in this context.\u00a0 Hawaii, unlike some other states, has not, to date, given its prosecutors statutory power to grant immunity.\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7702-225 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 Re Habeas Corpus, Balucan, 44 Haw. 271, 353 P.2d 631 (1960) (\"It of course is true that a female may be convicted as an accomplice to an act which a female is incapable of perpetrating herself.\").\n\u00a0\n2.\u00a0 See Republic v. Ruttmann, 11 Haw. 591 (1898).\u00a0 In Ruttmann, the defendant was charged for a crime on the basis of the defendant's own conduct and on the basis of the conduct of another.\u00a0 The court held that the prior acquittal of the other person was not a defense because the defendant had also been charged on the basis of the defendant's own conduct.\u00a0 The opinion indicates implied acceptance of the common-law position."
