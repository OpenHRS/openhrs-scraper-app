[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; am L 1986, c 314, pt of \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7701-100\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 The purpose of this Code is to codify the major part of Hawaii's penal law.\u00a0 The law has never before been completely codified.\u00a0 Judicial construction has been relied on to supply definitions, defenses, and general principles of penal liability.\u00a0 The statutory law, dating from time long past, uses language which is now obscure or mysterious.\u00a0 Unmeritorious defenses have been allowed because of the law's incompleteness, and some persons have escaped punishment because some new variation of criminal conduct is not defined as a crime.\u00a0 On the other hand, certain acts are defined as crimes which are not considered criminal today by a great majority of the people.\u00a0 This Code corrects these defects in the law, while putting it in a more rational and accessible form.\n\u00a0\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON \u00a7701-100\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Act 314, Session Laws 1986, provided that that Act's amendments to the Code take effect on January 1, 1987.\u00a0 By delaying the effective date of the amendments, the legislature intended to give criminal justice agencies time to determine how the amendments will affect them and to make provisions for the changes.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 51-86."
