[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7701-116\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 The draft follows the Model Penal Code in defining a standard of proof of facts called for in application of the Code.\u00a0 It would cover, for example, a finding that the defendant lacks mental capacity to proceed.[1]\u00a0 It logically places the burden of proof on the side whose interest or contention would be furthered if the finding is made.\u00a0 Proof must be by a preponderance of the evidence.\u00a0 Thus when facts making the defendant subject to increased penalties must be proved,[2] the prosecution need not prove them beyond a reasonable doubt, but only by preponderant evidence.\u00a0 The Model Penal Code draftsmen explain:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ... proof that satisfies the court is not likely to leave room for a substantial doubt; and this, in our view, affords an adequate protection in an area where we deliberately have sought to broaden the discretion of the court.[3]\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7701-116 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 Cf. \u00a7\u00a7704-403 to 406.\n\u00a0\n2.\u00a0 Cf. \u00a7706-662.\n\u00a0\n3.\u00a0 M.P.C., Tentative Draft No. 4, comments at 114 (1955)."
