[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7701-104\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 This section, read in conjunction with \u00a7701-103, is intended to assure that this Code will be construed by the courts in such a way as to effectuate the declared purposes of the law.\n\u00a0\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON \u00a7701-104\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Section 104 of the Proposed Draft of the Code read:\u00a0 \"The rule that a penal statute is to be strictly construed does not apply to this Code, but the provisions herein must be construed according to the fair import of their terms.\"\u00a0 The legislature found that such broad wording would subject the Code to unwarranted argument and attempted to avoid this possibility by revising the entire section.\u00a0 Through the section, as enacted, the legislature sought to limit the scope of the fair import principle.\u00a0 See Conference Committee Report No. 2 (1972).\u00a0 The committee report also states:\u00a0 \"It is the intent of the Committee that definitions of crimes are to be strictly construed.\"\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 In Coray v. Ariyoshi, 54 H. 254, 506 P.2d 13 (1973), and State v. Rackle, 55 H. 531, 523 P.2d 299 (1974), the court reiterated without discussion the doctrine of strict construction.\u00a0 The offenses in each case occurred prior to enactment of the Code.\n\u00a0 Where words of general description follow enumeration of specific things, the words are restricted to like objects.\u00a0 56 H. 481, 541 P.2d 1020 (1975).\n\u00a0 Rule of strict construction does not override other fundamental rules of construction.\u00a0 59 H. 456, 583 P.2d 337 (1978).\n\u00a0 Proscription of distribution of lysergic acid \"diethylamine\" under \u00a7329-14 (1974) cannot be extended by analogy to distribution of lysergic acid diethylamide.\u00a0 61 H. 74, 595 P.2d 288 (1979).\n\u00a0 Cited in construing \"accident\".\u00a0 1 H. App. 625, 623 P.2d 1271 (1981).\n\u00a0 Cited in construing \"possession\".\u00a0 8 H. App. 610, 822 P.2d 23 (1991)."
