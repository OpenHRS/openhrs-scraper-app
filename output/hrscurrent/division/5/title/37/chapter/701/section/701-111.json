[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nRevision Note\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 In paragraph (1)(a), \"or\" deleted pursuant to \u00a723G-15.\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7701-111\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 This section parallels \u00a7701-110, but has to do with different offenses rather than the same offense.\u00a0 It would thus, for example, be the appropriate section to use in the case of a new prosecution for an offense already prosecuted for under the law existing prior to the effective date of this Code.\u00a0 In short, it forbids reprosecuting when the defendant has previously been prosecuted for an offense arising out of the same factual situation in certain specified cases.\u00a0 The section must be read in conjunction with \u00a7701-109(2) which requires joinder of trials of \"multiple offenses based on the same conduct or arising from the same episode.\"\u00a0 Both \u00a7701-109(2) and \u00a7701-111 effectuate the policy of preserving the defendant from numerous and vexatious prosecutions.\n\u00a0 Subsection (1) applies where the former prosecution resulted in a conviction or an acquittal and the subsequent prosecution is either (a) for any offense of which the defendant could have been convicted in the first prosecution (e.g., an included offense), (b) for any offense for which the defendant should have been tried at the earlier trial under \u00a7701-110, or (c) for an offense based on the same conduct, unless proof of a fact not required by the former prosecution is required and the law defining each offense is intended to prevent a substantially different harm or evil, or unless the second offense was not consummated when the former trial began.\n\u00a0 Subsection (2) is an important provision, giving a sort of collateral estoppel effect to a former prosecution resulting in acquittal or final order or judgment for the defendant which required a determination inconsistent with a fact which must be established for conviction of the second offense.\u00a0 As an example of how this would work, we may take the case of an injury caused by allegedly reckless driving by D.\u00a0 Suppose, for example, that D is first charged with a traffic offense which by definition is limited to reckless driving, and the case results in an explicit determination that, under all the circumstances, D was not reckless.\u00a0 If D is later charged with manslaughter, which requires proof of recklessness,[1] D would be entitled to an acquittal.\u00a0 D would not, however, be able to avoid a trial for negligent homicide, which requires proof of a lesser degree of culpability.\n\u00a0 Subsection (3) deals with the case of improper termination of a prosecution.\u00a0 The defendant may not later be tried for an offense of which the defendant could have been convicted had the former prosecution not been improperly terminated.\u00a0 Once the trial has begun, only exceptional circumstances should permit the State to discontinue it.\u00a0 Otherwise the defendant may be prejudiced by having the defendant's trial tactics exposed and the defendant's witnesses subjected to unfair pressures.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 In 1970, prior to the enactment of the Penal Code, the Supreme Court adopted the standard set forth in \u00a7111 of the Proposed Draft, Hawaii Penal Code 1970, as \"a satisfactory approach\" to the problem of when a former prosecution for a different offense (i.e., violation of a different statutory provision) will constitute a bar to a current prosecution.\u00a0 The court quoted subsection (1)(c)(i).\u00a0 The entire section was adopted by the legislature without change.\u00a0 See State v. Ahuna, 52 H. 321, 326, 474 P.2d 704 (1970).\u00a0 See also State v. Pia, 55 H. 14, 514 P.2d 580 (1973), which dealt primarily with \u00a7701-109.\n\u00a0 Subsection (1)(c) applies only when \u00a7701-109(2) does not apply.\u00a0 59 H. 92, 576 P.2d 1044 (1978).\n\u00a0 Section does not prevent a retrial of charges brought together pursuant to \u00a7701-109.\u00a0 70 H. 332, 770 P.2d 420 (1989).\n\u00a0 Appellate determination that insufficient evidence was presented at trial to support a conviction does not constitute an \"acquittal\", as that term is used in paragraph (1); thus, retrial on lesser included offenses following such determination did not violate paragraph (1)(c).\u00a0 80 H. 126, 906 P.2d 612 (1995).\n\u00a0 When a defendant is charged in a single indictment or complaint and one or more counts are terminated on a basis unrelated to factual guilt or innocence, retrial not barred by \u00a7701-109(2) and paragraph (1)(b); thus, defendant's retrial on place to keep firearms charge under \u00a7134-6 not barred.\u00a0 88 H. 389, 967 P.2d 221 (1998).\n\u00a0 Where charged offenses in search warrant case and drug buy case arose from the \"same episode\" inasmuch as defendant's conduct was \"so closely related in time, place and circumstances that a complete account of one charge could not have been related without referring to the details of the other charge\", trial court erred in denying defendant's motion to dismiss based upon the prosecution's failure to join the search warrant offenses and the drug buy offenses in a single prosecution.\u00a0 118 H. 44, 185 P.3d 229 (2008).\n\u00a0 Trial court did not err when it interpreted the relevant provisions of paragraph (1)(b) and \u00a7701-109(2) as prohibiting the court from granting defendant's pretrial motion to dismiss where the three charges against the defendant were based upon incidents occurring on different dates and at different places under distinct circumstances, and were patently not \"based on the same conduct or arising from the same episode\".\u00a0 108 H. 195 (App.), 118 P.3d 678 (2005).\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7701-111 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 Cf. \u00a7707-702."
