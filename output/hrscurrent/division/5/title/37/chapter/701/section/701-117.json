[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; am L 1986, c 314, \u00a73]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7701-117\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 In drafting the Code, we have substituted the concept of prima facie evidence for presumptions, which appear to create insurmountable difficulties for lawyers, courts, and juries.\u00a0 Often it is desirable to enable the prosecution to get to the jury on something less than positive proof of a fact which may be almost solely within the knowledge of the defendant.\u00a0 As an example, \u00a7701-106(4) makes proof of the finding of a body of a homicide victim within the State prima facie evidence that the bodily impact causing death or the death itself occurred within the State, giving Hawaii's courts jurisdiction.\u00a0 Obviously it may be very difficult to prove where the criminal result occurred, and the presence of the body is a good indication that the result occurred here.\u00a0 On the other hand, although the prosecution's case gets to the jury on this point, the defendant can win by suggesting a reasonable doubt that the death or bodily impact did occur within the State.\u00a0 Thus, the prima facie evidence rule helps the prosecution to get its case to the jury without necessarily meeting its burden of persuasion.\u00a0 This is consistent with modern rules of evidence.\u00a0 See California Evidence Code \u00a7\u00a7601-02, 604.\n\u00a0\nLaw Journals and Reviews\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 The Lum Court and the First Amendment.\u00a0 14 UH L.
