[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; am L 1973, c 136, \u00a72(b)]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7701-115\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 The Code establishes two classes of defenses.\u00a0 As to both, it places an initial burden on the defendant to come forward with some credible evidence of facts constituting the defense, unless, of course, those facts are supplied by the prosecution's witnesses.\n\u00a0 As to the burden of persuasion, two different rules are codified.\u00a0 In the case of defenses which are not affirmative, the defendant need only raise a reasonable doubt as to the defendant's guilt.\u00a0 The other side of the coin is that the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt facts negativing the defense.\u00a0 The prosecution in fact does this when the jury believes its case and disbelieves the defense.\n\u00a0 In the case of affirmative defenses, the burden on the defendant increases.\u00a0 Now the defendant must prove by a preponderance of the evidence facts which negative the defendant's penal liability.\u00a0 Subsection (4) defines \"affirmative defense,\" making it clear that this type of defense needs special legislative prescription.\u00a0 Unless the legislature has made a particular defense affirmative, the defendant's burden is only to raise a reasonable doubt.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Provisions of this section and \u00a7702-237, requiring defendant to prove entrapment by preponderance of the evidence, do not violate due process.\u00a0 58 H. 234, 566 P.2d 1370 (1977).\n\u00a0 Provisions on entrapment not inconsistent with \u00a7702-205.\u00a0 58 H. 479, 572 P.2d 159 (1977).\n\u00a0 Requirement that defendant establish entrapment is not violation of due process.\u00a0 58 H. 479, 572 P.2d 159 (1977).\n\u00a0 Justification is not an affirmative defense and prosecution has burden of disproving it once evidence of justification has been adduced.\u00a0 60 H. 259, 588 P.2d 438 (1978).\n\u00a0 Due process violation where jury may have reached verdict by improperly shifting burden of proof from prosecution to defense by concluding that defendant had not established defendant's claim of extreme mental or emotional distress before considering whether prosecution had disproved that defense beyond a reasonable doubt.\u00a0 80 H. 172, 907 P.2d 758 (1995).\n\u00a0 Trial courts must specifically instruct juries, where the record so warrants, that the burden is upon the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was not ignorant or mistaken as to a fact that negates the state of mind required to establish an element of the charged offense or offenses.\u00a0 107 H. 239, 112 P.3d 725 (2005).\n\u00a0 Rule of lenity required the construction, under the specific facts of the case, of \u00a7\u00a7329-121, 329-122, and 329-125 against the government, as there was an irreconcilable inconsistency between the authorized transportation of medical marijuana under \u00a7329-121, and the prohibition on transport of medical marijuana through \"any ... place open to the public\" under [\u00a7329-122(c)(2)(E)]; thus, under subsection (2)(b), petitioner was entitled to an acquittal because petitioner's evidence, when considered in light of any contrary prosecution evidence proved by a preponderance of the evidence the specified fact or facts with negatived penal liability.\u00a0 129 H. 397, 301 P.3d 607 (2013).\n\u00a0 Synthesizing and applying this section, its commentary, and the Hawaii supreme court's ruling in State v. Malaega in the context of this case, in the case of an unrequested mistake of fact jury instruction denominated as error for the first time on appeal, subsection (2) and its commentary place the burden of production on the defendant to present [(\"credible\")] evidence of the specified facts going to the defense.\u00a0 Further, failure to give the mistake of fact jury instruction under these circumstances constitutes plain error; moreover, where the omission of the instruction constitutes plain error, it shall be a basis for reversal of the defendant's conviction only if an examination of the record as a whole reveals that the error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u00a0 130 H. 196, 307 P.3d 1142 (2013).\n\u00a0 Defendant's claim of justification, in defense against prosecution for terroristic threatening, was established regardless of whether or not defendant used deadly force.\u00a0 1 H. App. 167, 616 P.2d 229 (1980).\n\u00a0 Court's instruction that defendant had the burden of proving self defense by a preponderance of the evidence was plain error which affected substantial rights of the defendant.\u00a0 1 H. App. 214, 617 P.2d 573 (1980).\n\u00a0 Since exception to animal nuisance offense, if proved, would negative defendant's penal liability for animal nuisance, it constituted a defense; because defendant offered absolutely no evidence at trial, and the facts constituting defendant's defense were not supplied by the State, the State was not required to present any evidence disproving defendant's defense beyond a reasonable doubt.\u00a0 10 H. App. 353, 873 P.2d 110 (1994).\n\u00a0 Defense that someone other than defendant confessed to the offense and alibi defense, i.e., evidence that defendant was not present at the time of the crime, are not affirmative defenses.\u00a0 10 H. App. 448, 877 P.2d 891 (1994).\n\u00a0 Defendants did not prove affirmative defense of entrapment under \u00a7702-237(1)(b) by preponderance of evidence as required by subsection (2)(b); officer's conduct merely provided defendants with opportunity to commit offense of promoting a dangerous drug in the first degree.\u00a0 82 H. 499 (App.), 923 P.2d 916 (1996).\n\u00a0 Proof of self-insurance under \u00a7431:10C-105 is a \"defense\" within the meaning of this section.\u00a0 90 H. 130 (App.), 976 P.2d 444 (1999)."
