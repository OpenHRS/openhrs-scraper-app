Ouye.[2]\u00a0 In that case it was held that the defendant's unlawful act of being present at a gambling game, for which the defendant had been convicted, was merged in the defendant's alleged act of conducting the game.\u00a0 Likewise, in Territory v. Silva,[3] it was held that the defendant could not be held guilty of rape when the defendant was previously convicted of assault and battery based on the same conduct.\n\u00a0\nLaw Journals and Reviews\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Included Offenses in Hawaii Case Law and the Rights to Trial by Jury:\u00a0 Coherence or Confusion.\u00a0 II HBJ, no. 13, at 77 (1998).\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 In State v. Pia, 55 H. 14, 514 P.2d 580 (1973), the defendants were charged with a battery on a police officer with intent to obstruct the officer in the performance of the officer's duties and with interference with a police officer while executing the officer's duties (as those offenses were defined under previous Hawaii law).\u00a0 The court held that a plea of guilty and conviction for one offense did not bar prosecution for the other where the offenses were \"separate not only statutorily but also spatially and temporally\"--even though the separation in space was only a short distance and the separation in time was only a few seconds.\u00a0 The court said that \"where a defendant in the context of one criminal scheme or transaction commits several acts independently violative of one or more statutes, he may be punished for all of them if charges are properly consolidated by the State in one trial.\u00a0 Indeed, joinder of offenses is now mandatory in such circumstances under Hawaii Penal Code \u00a7109(2), a provision which seeks to insulate individuals from the harassment of multiple trials for the same general criminal episode under technically different statutory provisions.\u00a0 Cf. State v. Ahuna, [52 H. 321, 474 P.2d 704 (1970)].\"\u00a0 State v. Pia, supra at 19, 514 P.2d at 584.\n\u00a0 Subsection (2) acts as procedural limitation to State's power under subsection (1) to seek convictions for all offenses.\u00a0 59 H. 92, 576 P.2d 1044 (1978).\n\u00a0 Prosecutorial knowledge requirement met where prosecutor knows more than one charge is pending and fails to join the charges; police officer's knowledge of additional offense was not knowledge of an \"appropriate prosecuting officer\" under subsection (2).\u00a0 61 H. 127, 596 P.2d 779 (1979).\n\u00a0 Reckless endangering in the second degree is a lesser included offense of attempted murder.\u00a0 62 H. 637, 618 P.2d 306 (1980).\n\u00a0 Harassment is not a lesser included offense of assault in the third degree under subsection (4)(a) or (c).\u00a0 63 H. 1, 620 P.2d 250 (1980).\n\u00a0 The \"same episode\" in subsection (2) construed.\u00a0 63 H. 345, 627 P.2d 776 (1981).\n\u00a0 Harassment not a lesser included offense of disorderly conduct under subsection (4).\u00a0 63 H. 548, 632 P.2d 654 (1981).\n\u00a0 Rape and sodomy not specific instances of kidnapping; prohibition against multiple convictions not applicable where defendant's actions constituted separate offenses.\u00a0 68 H. 246, 710 P.2d 1193 (1985).\n\u00a0 Assault in the third degree is not a lesser included offense of assault in the second degree.\u00a0 68 H. 276, 711 P.2d 1289 (1985).\n\u00a0 No double jeopardy where crimes charged involved different mens rea requirements and different facts proved each crime.\u00a0 68 H. 280, 711 P.2d 731 (1985).\n\u00a0 No basis in evidence for acquitting defendant of offense charged and convicting defendant of included offense.\u00a0 68 H. 463, 718 P.2d 280 (1986).\n\u00a0 Harassment is not a lesser included offense of terroristic threatening in the first degree.\u00a0 70 H. 85, 762 P.2d 164 (1988).\n\u00a0 Section 707-111 does not prevent a retrial where charges for DUI and driving with 0.10 per cent alcohol are brought together, and a mistrial is declared on one charge because of the jury's inability to agree.\u00a0 70 H. 332, 770 P.2d 420 (1989).\n\u00a0 Theft in the second degree is not a lesser included offense of fraudulent use of a credit card.\u00a0 70 H. 434, 774 P.2d 888 (1989).\n\u00a0 State was barred from prosecuting defendant for felony offenses by defendant's conviction for misdemeanor marijuana possession charge.\u00a0 72 H. 35, 804 P.2d 1347 (1991).\n\u00a0 Compulsory joinder of offenses requirement applies to criminal contempt charges under \u00a7710-1077(4).\u00a0 72 H. 164, 811 P.2d 815, cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 194 (1991).\n\u00a0 Negligent homicide is a lesser included offense of manslaughter.\u00a0 72 H. 217, 811 P.2d 1100 (1991).\n\u00a0 Where petitioner's convictions on counts I (attempted first degree murder), II (second degree murder), and III (attempted second degree murder) violated subsection(1)(c)'s clear prohibition against inconsistent factual findings, the failure to raise this issue, both at trial and on appeal, resulted in withdrawal of not only a potentially meritorious defense, but a defense that would have altered the outcome.\u00a0 74 H. 442, 848 P.2d 966 (1993).\n\u00a0 Trial court did not commit plain error when it allowed defendant to be convicted of kidnapping in addition to sexual assault and assault.\u00a0 75 H. 152, 857 P.2d 579 (1993).\n\u00a0 Terroristic threatening not a lesser included offense of intimidating a witness within the meaning of subsection (4)(a); multiple conviction of terroristic threatening and intimidating a witness not barred by subsection (4)(c).\u00a0 75 H. 517, 865 P.2d 157 (1994).\n\u00a0 Circuit court was obligated, even absent a request by either party, to instruct the jury regarding the included offense of assault in third degree where appellant was charged with committing offense of assault in second degree; court's failure to do so constituted plain error.\u00a0 76 H. 387, 879 P.2d. 492 (1994).\n\u00a0 Trial judge erred in refusing to instruct jury regarding the possible merger of the robbery and kidnapping counts against defendant.\u00a0 77 H. 17, 881 P.2d 504 (1994).\n\u00a0 Where appellant convicted of committing two burglaries and of criminal conspiracy contended that jury was not adequately instructed with respect to its ability to convict appellant of both the conspiracy and substantive burglary offense charges, appellant's requested instructions did not adequately explicate the law in this area and were properly rejected; failure to properly instruct the jury was harmless as to convictions for the two substantive burglaries; supreme court could not conclude that circuit court's failure to properly instruct jury as to which overt acts it could consider was harmless.\u00a0 78 H. 383, 894 P.2d 80 (1995).\n\u00a0 Sexual assault in the fourth degree and attempted sexual assault in the fourth degree are included offenses of attempted sexual assault in the second degree, within the meaning of subsection (4)(c).\u00a0 79 H. 46, 897 P.2d 973 (1995).\n\u00a0 Theft and attempted theft, regardless of degree, are included offenses of first degree robbery.\u00a0 81 H. 309, 916 P.2d 1210 (1996).\n\u00a0 Trial court should have applied subsections (1)(a) and (4)(b) to merge defendant's conviction for attempted first degree murder into conviction for first degree murder.\u00a0 81 H. 358, 917 P.2d 370 (1996).\n\u00a0 Sexual assault in the fourth degree under \u00a7707-733(1)(a) not an included offense of sexual assault in the third degree under \u00a7707-732(1)(b) as defined by subsection (4).\u00a0 83 H. 308, 926 P.2d 599 (1996).\n\u00a0 Subsection (1)(d) prohibits conviction under both \u00a7712-1203 and \u00a7842-2(2), as both statutes seek to redress the same conduct--the control of an enterprise involved in criminal activity.\u00a0 In such case, the specific statute, \u00a7712-1203, governs over the general statute, \u00a7842-2(2).\u00a0 88 H. 19, 960 P.2d 1227 (1998).\n\u00a0 When a defendant is charged in a single indictment or complaint and one or more counts are terminated on a basis unrelated to factual guilt or innocence, retrial not barred by subsection (2) and \u00a7701-111(1)(b); thus, defendant's retrial on place to keep firearms charge under \u00a7134-6 not barred.\u00a0 88 H. 389, 967 P.2d 221 (1998).\n\u00a0 The crime underlying a \u00a7134-51(b) offense is, as a matter of law, an included offense of the \u00a7134-51(b) offense, within the meaning of subsection (4)(a), and defendant should not have been convicted of both the \u00a7134-51(b) offense and the underlying second degree murder offense; thus, defendant's conviction of\u00a0 the \u00a7134-51(b) offense reversed.\u00a0 88 H. 407, 967 P.2d 239 (1998).\n\u00a0 Where defendant's conviction and sentence under \u00a7708-840 was an included offense under \u00a7134-6(a) and defendant's convictions under both \u00a7\u00a7134-4(a) and 708-840 violated subsection (1)(a), defendant's conviction and sentence under \u00a7708-840 reversed.\u00a0 91 H. 33, 979 P.2d 1059 (1999).\n\u00a0 Under either subsection (4)(a) or (4)(c), a petty misdemeanor assault under \u00a7707-712(2) is not a lesser included offense of family abuse under \u00a7709-906.\u00a0 93 H. 63, 996 P.2d 268 (2000).\n\u00a0 Pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7705-500(1)(b) and (3), 134-7(b), and subsection (4)(b), attempted prohibited possession of a firearm is an included offense of prohibited possession of a firearm.\u00a0 93 H. 199, 998 P.2d 479 (2000).\n\u00a0 Trial courts must instruct juries as to any included offenses when, pursuant to subsection (5), \"there is a rational basis in the evidence for a verdict acquitting the defendant of the offense charged and convicting the defendant of the included offense\".\u00a0 94 H. 405, 16 P.3d 246 (2001).\n\u00a0 Trial courts must instruct juries on all lesser included offenses as specified by subsection (5), despite any objection by the defense, and even in the absence of a request from the prosecution.\u00a0 94 H. 405, 16 P.3d 246 (2001).\n\u00a0 The original 1990 enactment of \u00a7134-6(a) prohibited the conviction of a defendant for both a \u00a7134-6(a) offense and its underlying felony.\u00a0 101 H. 187, 65 P.3d 134 (2003).\n\u00a0 Where question whether defendant's conduct constituted separate and distinct culpable acts or an uninterrupted continuous course of conduct was one of fact that should have been submitted to the jury, trial court's jury instructions, which omitted the possible merger of counts I and II, pursuant to subsection (1)(e), were prejudicially insufficient and erroneous.\u00a0 102 H. 300, 75 P.3d 1191 (2003).\n\u00a0 Given the reasonable possibility that the jury's verdict led to two convictions for \"the same conduct\", the trial court's failure to charge the jury with respect to merger contravened subsection (1)(e) and was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u00a0 114 H. 76, 156 P.3d 1182 (2007).\n\u00a0 Where charged offenses in search warrant case and drug buy case arose from the \"same episode\" inasmuch as defendant's conduct was \"so closely related in time, place and circumstances that a complete account of one charge could not have been related without referring to the details of the other charge\", trial court erred in denying defendant's motion to dismiss based upon the prosecution's failure to join the search warrant offenses and the drug buy offenses in a single prosecution.\u00a0 118 H. 44, 185 P.3d 229 (2008).\n\u00a0 There was a rational basis for the jury to find defendant guilty of unlawful imprisonment in the first degree, had the jury been given the appropriate instruction.\u00a0 The failure to instruct the jury on a lesser included offense for which the evidence provided a rational basis warranted vacating defendant's conviction for kidnapping.\u00a0 131 H. 43, 314 P.3d 120 (2013).\n\u00a0 Under subsection (4)(c), unlawful imprisonment in the first degree is a lesser-included offense of kidnapping because unlawful imprisonment in the first degree involves a less culpable mental state than kidnapping.\u00a0 131 H. 43, 314 P.3d 120 (2013).\n\u00a0 Under subsection (1)(c), petitioner could not be convicted of both robbery in the second degree (\u00a7708-841) and assault in the first degree (\u00a7707-710); the jury inconsistently found that petitioner intentionally or knowingly and recklessly inflicted serious bodily injury on complainant.\u00a0 131 H. 419, 319 P.3d 338 (2014).\n\u00a0 Assault in the first degree is a lesser included offense of murder in the second degree.\u00a0 The circuit court erred in failing to instruct the jury on the included offense of assault in the first degree.\u00a0 132 H. 451, 323 P.3d 95 (2014).\n\u00a0 Fact that kidnapping continued during sexual abuse did not cause kidnapping to be included offense of sexual abuse.\u00a0 5 H. App. 127, 681 P.2d 573 (1984).\n\u00a0 Kidnapping not necessarily and incidentally committed during robbery may be charged as separate offense.\u00a0 5 H. App. 644, 706 P.2d 1321 (1985).\n\u00a0 \"Convicted\" means guilty verdict, not sentence and judgment; under this section and \u00a7705-531, defendant cannot be found guilty of being an accomplice to an attempted crime and of conspiracy to commit the same crime.\u00a0 5 H. App. 651, 706 P.2d 1326 (1985).\n\u00a0 Under this section and \u00a7705-531, defendant cannot be found guilty of conspiracy to commit crime and the crime itself.\u00a0 5 H. App. 670, 706 P.2d 1331 (1985).\n\u00a0 Criminal trespass in the first degree is a lesser included offense of burglary in the first degree; when lesser included offense instruction should be given.\u00a0 6 H. App. 17, 708 P.2d 834 (1985).\n\u00a0 Kidnapping was not necessarily and incidentally committed during rape; prohibition against multiple convictions not applicable.\u00a0 6 H. App. 77, 711 P.2d 1303 (1985).\n\u00a0 Assault in the third degree is not a lesser included offense of robbery in the first degree.\u00a0 6 H. App. 115, 711 P.2d 736 (1985).\n\u00a0 Although section bars conviction of a person for committing an offense and the conspiring to commit that same offense, section does not preclude conviction of a person for conspiring to commit more than two criminal acts and of committing two of the criminal acts planned by the conspiracy.\u00a0 7 H. App. 526, 783 P.2d 1232 (1989).\n\u00a0 Jury is to consider the charged offense then the lesser included offenses in descending order.\u00a0 8 H. App. 1, 791 P.2d 407 (1990).\n\u00a0 Theft and forgery charges had to be paired together.\u00a0 8 H. App. 284, 800 P.2d 623 (1990).\n\u00a0 An offense under \u00a7291C-15 is an included offense under \u00a7\u00a7291C-13 and 291C-14.\u00a0 9 H. App. 156, 828 P.2d 298 (1992).\n\u00a0 Terroristic threatening in second degree can be an offense included in terroristic threatening in first degree; trial court's failure to instruct jury on the lesser included offense was not plain error, where defendant contended there was a rational basis in the record for jury to decide that, although defendant made a terroristic threat, defendant did not do so with a dangerous instrument as defined in \u00a7707-700.\u00a0 10 H. App. 584, 880 P.2d 213 (1994).\n\u00a0 Since to sell and to barter do not include to prescribe, \u00a7712-1248(1)(d) is not a lesser included offense of \u00a7712-1247(1)(h).\u00a0 78 H. 488 (App.), 896 P.2d 944 (1995).\n\u00a0 Driving without license under \u00a7286-102 not lesser included offense of driving while license suspended under \u00a7286-132.\u00a0 81 H. 76 (App.), 912 P.2d 573 (1996).\n\u00a0 Based on subsection (4)(a), fourth degree sexual assault under \u00a7707-733(1)(a) is a lesser included offense of third degree sexual assault under \u00a7707-732(1)(e).\u00a0 85 H. 92 (App.), 937 P.2d 933 (1997).\n\u00a0 Third degree sexual assault committed in violation of \u00a7707-732(1)(e) not a continuous offense; defendant's convictions of five counts of that offense, each based on a separate sexual contact thus did not violate subsection (1)(e).\u00a0 85 H. 92 (App.), 937 P.2d 933 (1997).\n\u00a0 Under subsections (1)(a) and (4), defendant could not be convicted of kidnapping charge in addition to sexual assault charges where jury relied on same leg restraint on complainant to convict defendant of both charges.\u00a0 85 H. 92 (App.), 937 P.2d 933 (1997).\n\u00a0 Under subsection (4)(a) and (c), reckless endangering in the first degree under \u00a7707-713 is an included offense of attempted murder in the second degree under \u00a7707-701.5.\u00a0 94 H. 513 (App.), 17 P.3d 862 (2001).\n\u00a0 Subsection (1)(e) prohibition against conviction for more than one offense when defendant's conduct establishes an element of more than one offense not violated by defendant's convictions for driving under the influence of drugs under \u00a7291-7 and inattentive driving under \u00a7291-12 as driving under the influence of drugs required defendant to be under the influence of drugs and inattention to driving did not.\u00a0 98 H. 188 (App.), 46 P.3d 1 (2002).\n\u00a0 As rational basis existed in the record to support trial court's determination that jury could find defendants guilty of attempted assault in the second degree but not attempted assault in the first degree, trial court did not err in giving lesser included offense instruction.\u00a0 104 H. 517 (App.), 92 P.3d 1027 (2004).\n\u00a0 Trial court did not err when it interpreted the relevant provisions of subsection (2) and \u00a7701-111(1)(b) as prohibiting the court from granting defendant's pretrial motion to dismiss where the three charges against the defendant were based upon incidents occurring on different dates and at different places under distinct circumstances, and were patently not \"based on the same conduct or arising from the same episode\".\u00a0 108 H. 195 (App.), 118 P.3d 678 (2005).\n\u00a0 As attempted assault in the first degree is an included offense of assault in the first degree, under subsection (4), the trial court properly instructed the jury on the included offense of attempted assault in the first degree; as trial court's instructing the jury on the included offense of attempted assault in the first degree only placed defendant in jeopardy once, defendant's double jeopardy rights not violated.\u00a0 112 H. 278 (App.), 145 P.3d 821 (2006).\n\u00a0 Subsection (1)(e) only prohibits conviction for two offenses if the offenses merge; it specifically permits prosecution on both offenses; even if the felon-in-possession and the place-to-keep charges merged pursuant to this subsection, conviction on one of the two charges was possible; thus, where trial court committed plain error in failing to give an instruction regarding the possible merger of the two counts, \"a new trial was not necessary because the State could obviate the error by dismissing either count\".\u00a0 114 H. 507 (App.), 164 P.3d 765 (2007).\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7701-109 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 H.R.S. \u00a7706-4.\n\u00a0\n2.\u00a0 37 Haw. 176 (1945).\n\u00a0\n3.\u00a0 27 Haw. 270 (1923)."
