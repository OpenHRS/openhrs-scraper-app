[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7701-113\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 A subsequent prosecution should not be barred when the former prosecution was before a court lacking jurisdiction over the defendant or the offense.\u00a0 A prosecution by a court without jurisdiction is a nullity, and reprosecuting the defendant does not place the defendant twice in jeopardy because the defendant never in fact was in jeopardy.\u00a0 Likewise, if the defendant improperly procured the former prosecution without the knowledge of the appropriate prosecuting officer and with the intention of avoiding the sentence which might otherwise be imposed, the former prosecution is not a bar.\u00a0 Finally, if defendant succeeds in having the former proceeding held invalid by means of habeas corpus or coram nobis, a reprosecution should not be barred."
