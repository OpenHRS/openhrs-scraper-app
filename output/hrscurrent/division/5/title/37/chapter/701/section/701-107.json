App. 115, 826 P.2d 884 (1992).\n\u00a0 Although a violation does not constitute a crime, it constitutes a penal offense and the legislature intended its penalties to be criminal penalties.\u00a0 10 H. App. 220, 864 P.2d 1109 (1993).\n\u00a0 Defendant did not have a constitutional right to a jury trial for a violation of \u00a7852-1, refusal to provide ingress or egress while walking a labor picket line, where the maximum punishment was thirty days in jail or a $200 fine, or both, and violation was thus a petty misdemeanor under subsection (4).\u00a0 110 H. 139 (App.), 129 P.3d 1167 (2006).\n\u00a0 Cited:\u00a0 132 H. 36, 319 P.3d 1044 (2014)."
