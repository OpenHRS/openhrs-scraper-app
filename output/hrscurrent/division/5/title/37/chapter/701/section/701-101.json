[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; am L 1986, c 314, pt of \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nRevision Note\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Reference to subsection (3) in subsection (1) deleted.\n\u00a0\nCross References\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Application of the Penal Code to persons sentenced prior to its effective date, see L 1975, c 188.\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7701-101\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 In general this Code does not apply to offenses committed before its effective date.\u00a0 Subsection (1) contains a saving clause which keeps the prior law in effect to cover offenses committed prior to the effective date.\n\u00a0 Subsection (2) permits, in trials after the effective date of the Code, limited exceptions to the foregoing general rule.\u00a0 Subsection (2)(a) provides, upon request of the defendant, that defenses and mitigations under the new Code shall apply in trials of offenses committed prior to its effective date.\u00a0 The policy behind this provision is humanitarian.\u00a0 In enacting a defense, or in omitting from the Code an offense defined in previous law, the legislature will have determined that certain conduct is not criminal, or is justifiable or excusable.\u00a0 That conduct should not be penalized after such a decision is made even though technically it occurred before the effective date of the decision.\u00a0 This is, of course, quite a different matter from enacting retroactive offenses, which would be unconstitutional.\u00a0 Subsection (2)(b) covers two points.\u00a0 First it provides that, upon the request of the defendant and the approval of the court, the procedural provisions of the Code shall apply to prior offenses.\u00a0 These would include provisions on burden of proof and the procedures provided in chapter 704 relating to a determination of fitness to proceed and penal responsibility.\u00a0 Finally, the subsection permits use of the new sentencing provisions of this Code for offenses committed before the effective date.\u00a0 Again, the rationale is that defendants ought to be allowed the advantage of the new Code's more enlightened sentencing provisions in light of a legislative determination that they are preferable to the old.\n\u00a0 Subsection (3) applies the provisions of this Code to release and discharge of prisoners and to probation of persons sentenced for crimes committed before its effective date.\u00a0 Any other rule would create great administrative difficulties.\u00a0 The subsection specifies, however, that minimum and maximum periods shall not be increased.\u00a0 It also makes clear that the Code may not be used to attack the procedural or substantive validity of any judgment of conviction entered prior to the effective date of the Code, regardless of the fact that appeal time has not run or that an appeal is pending.\u00a0 If prior convictions were to be opened to attack on the basis of the Code, an intolerable burden would be placed on the prosecution and the courts.\n\u00a0\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON \u00a7701-101\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Act 314, Session Laws 1986, provided that that Act's amendments to the Code take effect on January 1, 1987.\u00a0 By delaying the effective date of the amendments, the legislature intended to give criminal justice agencies time to determine how the amendments will affect them and to make provisions for the changes.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 51-86.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \"Applicable offense\" in subsection 2(a) construed.\u00a0 56 H. 129, 531 P.2d 855 (1975).\n\u00a0 Subparagraph (2)(b)(ii) does not grant authority to alter sentences imposed under pre-Hawaii Penal Code.\u00a0 60 H. 309, 588 P.2d 927 (1979).\n\u00a0 Language of subsection (1) means that all elements necessary to prove a crime charged under Penal Code must be shown to have occurred after its effective date.\u00a0 62 H. 364, 616 P.2d 193 (1980).\n\u00a0 State may prosecute welfare fraud defendant under an indictment which covers only part of the duration of a continuing offense. \u00a062 H. 364, 616 P.2d 193 (1980).\n\u00a0 Section 701-108(6)(a) does not apply as a \"defense\" for purposes of subsection (2).\u00a0 62 H. 474, 617 P.2d 84 (1980)."
