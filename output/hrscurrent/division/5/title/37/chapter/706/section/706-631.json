[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; am L 1986, c 314, \u00a732]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7706-631\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 This section is addressed to the question of finality inherent in every disposition involving suspension of sentence or sentence to probation.\u00a0 As \u00a7\u00a7706-625 and 628 indicate, the conditions of suspension or probation may be modified or the disposition itself may be revoked.\u00a0 These features of suspension or probation are, of course, necessary in order that the sentencing authority can maintain control over the disposition.\u00a0 However, merely because the sentencing court maintains some continuing flexibility with respect to the disposition, the conviction and disposition should not be regarded as lacking finality for other purposes such as constituting a judgment for purposes of appeal and a prior conviction for purposes of extended imprisonment.\n\u00a0 This section, therefore, provides that a suspension of sentence or sentence to probation shall be deemed tentative to the extent provided in chapter 706, but for all other purposes such disposition shall constitute a final judgment."
