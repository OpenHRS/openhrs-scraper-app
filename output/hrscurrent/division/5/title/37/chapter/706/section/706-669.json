thus, an amended minimum term order issued by the authority did not \"cure\" the authority's initial violation of its guidelines and the petitioner did not have to show prejudice in order to obtain postconviction relief from the minimum term order.\u00a0 116 H. 181, 172 P.3d 493 (2007).\n\u00a0 Intermediate court of appeals erred in concluding that petitioner waived petitioner's due process claim relating to the Hawaii paroling authority's (HPA) nondisclosure of adverse materials in petitioner's HPA file, where petitioner would not have any opportunity to raise the issue of HPA's nondisclosure of evidence in any other proceeding if petitioner was not aware of the existence of letters sent between victim's aunt and HPA prior to petitioner's second minimum term hearing until they were filed with respondent State's response to petitioner's petition for post-conviction relief.\u00a0 129 H. 429, 302 P.3d 697 (2013).\n\u00a0 Inasmuch as the petitioner's offenses did not meet the prescribed criteria of a level III offender and no further written justification was provided explaining the Hawaii paroling authority's (HPA) decision, the HPA's action of classifying the petitioner as a level III offender was in violation of the HPA guidelines and therefore, under the circumstances, arbitrary and capricious.\u00a0 132 H. 224, 320 P.3d 889 (2014).\n\u00a0 Once the petitioner made a showing that the failure to raise the petitioner's claims in the first HRPP rule 40 petition was not an intelligent and knowing failure, it was unnecessary for the circuit court to reach the question of the existence of extraordinary circumstances, and the second petition should not have been denied without a hearing on the basis that the claims had been waived.\u00a0 132 H. 224, 320 P.3d 889 (2014).\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7706-669 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 See M.P.C. \u00a7\u00a76.06, 6.07, 305.6 and 305.7."
