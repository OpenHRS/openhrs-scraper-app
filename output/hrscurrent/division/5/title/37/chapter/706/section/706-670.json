affords the prisoner an opportunity to participate and be heard.\u00a0 The procedure also provides for periodic review of the prisoner's case.\n\u00a0 In the Proposed Draft, \u00a7670 provided for an automatic period of parole, the length of which would vary with the prisoner's initial period of incarceration, but which would not be greater than ten years, and which would be required in every case following an indeterminate term of imprisonment.\u00a0 The legislature did not accept this proposal in its entirety.\u00a0 Thus, subsection (4) now requires a prisoner's unconditional release at the expiration of the prisoner's maximum term of imprisonment.\u00a0 The legislature felt that to impose \"an additional term of parole would be an unfair burden to a person who has paid his debt to society.\"\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 2 (1972).\n\u00a0 Subsection (5) provides that the maximum term of parole shall be ten years.\u00a0 In this area, as in terms of imprisonment, the Code leaves with the Board of Paroles and Pardons the task of determining the minimum term of parole.\n\u00a0 Subsection (6) provides for a hearing on revocation of parole which affords the parolee fair notice, representation, and assistance, much in the same manner as that provided in the case of hearings on the minimum term and initial parole.\n\u00a0 Subsection (8) provides for unconditional discharge of the defendant when the maximum term of parole has expired or upon sooner release by the Board.\n\u00a0\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON \u00a7706-670\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Act 30, Session Laws 1983, amended subsection (1) to change the maximum term of recommittal for a parole violator from ten years to the remainder of the parolee's original, maximum sentence.\u00a0 It was felt that a parole violator should not be relieved of any part of the court-imposed maximum sentence.\u00a0 However, the legislature intended that the paroling authority periodically reconsider the parole of any recommitted parolee.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 357 (1983), House Standing Committee Report No. 811.\n\u00a0 Act 257, Session Laws 1984, added a new subsection (2) to allow the paroling authority, as a condition of parole, to prohibit a parolee from entering certain geographical areas without the paroling authority's permission.\n\u00a0 Act 282, Session Laws 1988, amended this section to allow the prosecuting attorney to appear and present oral comment and written testimony at parole hearings before the Hawaii paroling authority, disallowing oral testimony by witnesses.\u00a0 Senate Conference Committee Report No. 270, House Conference Committee Report No. 96-88.\n\u00a0 Act 101, Session Laws 1993, amended subsection (4) to clarify that a grant of parole is not subject to the acceptance of the person being paroled.\u00a0 Inmates who refuse parole and choose to remain in prison take up valuable bedspace in already crowded correctional facilities, and the State loses the opportunity to assist in reintegrating them back into the community.\u00a0 House Standing Committee Report No. 1123, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 839.\n\u00a0 Act 201, Session Laws 1993, amended subsection (3) to provide that prisoners who have been granted parole are to be paroled in the county where the prisoner had a permanent residence or occupation or employment prior to incarceration, unless the prisoner will reside in a county having a population exceeding 800,000 persons, or will be released for immediate departure from the State.\u00a0 The legislature found that this would prevent an influx of parolees whose roots are on Oahu from settling on the neighbor islands, which could strain a county's social service infrastructure.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 104.\n\u00a0 Act 193, Session Laws 1996, amended this section by providing that the prosecuting attorney shall have the right to be represented at the initial parole hearing and all subsequent parole hearings, and that the prosecuting attorney shall have reasonable notice of the reconsideration or rehearing of parole cases by the Hawaii paroling authority.\u00a0 The Act made clear the prosecuting attorney's right to be represented and to receive notice, since the current law was unclear regarding the prosecuting attorney's rights on these matters.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 60.\n\u00a0 Act 8, Special Session Laws 2007, amended subsection (3) to permit the Hawaii paroling authority to parole committed persons to the county in the State where the committed person has the greatest family or community support, opportunities for employment, job training, education, treatment, and other social services.\u00a0 This will allow the Hawaii paroling authority to provide meaningful opportunities for offenders to reintegrate into society and demonstrate that they have the potential to function as law-abiding citizens.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 993.\n\u00a0 Act 139, Session Laws 2012, amended this section, among other things, by:\u00a0 (1) requiring the department of public safety to select a research-based risk assessment tool and validate the accuracy of the risk assessment tool at least every five years in consultation with the Hawaii paroling authority; (2) specifying that parole shall be granted upon completion of the minimum term to a person who is assessed as low risk for reoffending unless the person, among other things, is found to have:\u00a0 (A) committed misconduct while in prison that is equivalent to a misdemeanor or felony crime within thirty-six months of the expiration of the minimum term of imprisonment; or (B) an extensive criminal history record that is indicative of a likelihood of future criminal behavior in spite of the finding by the risk assessment; and (3) requiring prisoners, in preparing their parole plan, to include, among other things, a phone contact, if any, where they can be reached.\u00a0 The purpose of Act 139 was to implement the recommendations of the justice reinvestment working group.\u00a0 Act 139 was a recommendation of the Council of State Governments Justice Center, which provided intensive technical assistance to Hawaii to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the State's criminal justice system and to help state leaders develop policy options that could increase public safety while saving taxpayer dollars.\u00a0 The Justice Center utilized a data-driven approach to identify inefficiencies, develop cost-effective policy options, and develop a plan for a reinvestment of savings that reduces recidivism and increases public safety.\u00a0 It was the legislature's intent to realize cost savings and reinvest those savings back into the corrections system to reduce recidivism, decrease the prison population, and strengthen public safety.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 165-12.\n\u00a0 Act 139, Session Laws 2012, also provided for the reenactment of subsection (1) upon the repeal of the amendments made by the Act on July 1, 2018.\n\u00a0 Act 67, Session Laws 2013, made a technical amendment to the repeal and reenactment provision of Act 139, Session Laws 2012, which affected this section.\n\u00a0 Act 231, Session Laws 2016, amended the repeal and reenactment provision of Act 139, Session Laws 2012.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Neither this chapter nor chapter 353 prohibits the Hawaii paroling authority from setting a prisoner's minimum term at a period equal to his or her maximum sentence.\u00a0 97 H. 183, 35 P.3d 210 (2001).\n\u00a0 As \u00a7353-66 and this section can be given effect without conflict, subsection (7) is not the \"exclusive\" law governing parole revocations, does not embrace the entire law on the subject, and does not repeal \u00a7353-66 by implication.\u00a0 88 H. 229 (App.), 965 P.2d 162 (1998).\n\u00a0 A petitioner is not entitled to relief for Hawaii paroling authority's failure to comply with time limit specified in subsection (7) for parole revocation hearing unless record shows that failure to comply (1) was unreasonable and (2) caused petitioner actual prejudice.\u00a0 State's failure to comply with specified time limit is presumptively unreasonable and it is Hawaii paroling authority's burden to rebut this presumption; it is petitioner's burden to prove that State's unreasonable failure to comply caused actual prejudice to petitioner.\u00a0 89 H. 474 (App.), 974 P.2d 1064 (1998)."
