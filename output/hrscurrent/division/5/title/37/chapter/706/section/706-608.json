[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; am L 1986, c 314, \u00a718]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7706-608\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Subsection (1) provides for the ordinary disposition in cases of convicted corporations and unincorporated associations, i.e., suspended sentence or fine.\n\u00a0\u00a0Subsection (2) provides for further sanctions in cases of corporate crime; dissolution of the corporate entity in the case of domestic corporations and revocation of a foreign corporation's right to do business within the State.\u00a0 Such sanctions are obviously severe and should be reserved for cases involving (1) intentional and persistent misconduct, and (2) a need for public protection which cannot be otherwise met.\u00a0 However, \"persistent misconduct need not be restricted to prior convictions of the corporation or its agents for criminal offenses.\"[1]\n\u00a0 The concentration of corporate wealth would tend to indicate that sanctions involving merely a fine may not be sufficient.\u00a0 However, although the Code authorizes forfeiture of the corporate charter and revocation of a foreign corporation's right to do business in the State, these sanctions are not automatic upon conviction or even a finding of persistent misconduct.\u00a0 Here, as in other areas, the Code provides a flexible approach by vesting discretion in the court.\n\u00a0 Subsection (3) provides that involuntary dissolution in a penal case shall follow procedures authorized by law for involuntary dissolution in a civil context.\n\u00a0 Unlike the Model Penal Code, which provides for institution of separate proceedings for forfeiture or revocation, this Code authorizes the sentencing court to decree forfeiture of a domestic corporate charter or revocation of a certificate of foreign corporation authorized to do business in this State.\u00a0 Unlike many jurisdictions in the United States, which the Model Penal Code was drafted to accommodate, criminal cases in Hawaii are not handled by courts of limited jurisdiction.\u00a0 The criminal calendar is rotated annually and neither lack of judicial expertise nor lack of judicial power would suggest that in Hawaii forfeiture or revocation should be handled by a separate court.\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7706-608 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 M.P.C., Tentative Draft No. 4, comments at 203 (1955)."
