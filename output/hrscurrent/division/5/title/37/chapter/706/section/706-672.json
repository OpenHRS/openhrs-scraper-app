[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; am L 1983, c 182, \u00a71; am L 1987, c 338, \u00a710; am L 1989, c 211, \u00a78; gen ch 1993]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7706-672\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 This section is substantially in accord with prior law.\u00a0 H.R.S. \u00a7711-83 (as codified prior to this Code) provided that felons be committed to the custody of the director of the department of social services and housing for placement within the correctional facilities of the department.\u00a0 Although there was no specific statutory direction that persons imprisoned for misdemeanors shall be incarcerated in county jails,[1] this was the usual practice.\n\u00a0\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON \u00a7706-672\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 In enacting the Code, the legislature added to \u00a7672(1) of the Proposed Draft the last sentence which allows the court to determine the initial place of confinement.\u00a0 The Conference Committee Report states that \"the Director of the Department of Social Services and Housing shall determine the proper program of redirection and any subsequent place of confinement best suited to meet the individual needs of the committed person.\"\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 2 (1972) (emphasis added).\u00a0 The committee also put its gloss on the word \"institution,\" appearing in subsection (2), by stating its \"intent that 'institution' refers to any detention or correctional facility other than Oahu prison.\"\u00a0 Id.\n\u00a0 Act 182, Session Laws 1983, amended this section to authorize the director of social services to determine a convicted person's place of confinement.\u00a0 Under prior law, courts determined the initial place of confinement for convicted persons with indeterminate prison terms and also determined the permanent place of confinement for convicted persons with definite prison terms.\u00a0 Because of that law, convicted persons were sometimes inappropriately housed due to the court's commitment or the prisoner's subsequent behavior.\u00a0 By amending this section, the director is able to place convicted persons in the most appropriate program and is better able to use the department's resources to provide for the safety of other prisoners and the department's staff.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 722, House Standing Committee Report No. 419.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0Nothing in the federal or the state constitution or the state statutory law entitles prisoner to a hearing in connection with the prisoner's transfer to a mainland prison.\u00a0 63 H. 138, 621 P.2d 976 (1981).\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7706-672 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 But cf. H.R.S. \u00a7710-12, which reads in part:\u00a0 \"The magistrate may direct, as one of the terms and conditions of such suspension of sentence, periodical or intermittent confinement of such person in jail or his attendance at a traffic course or school prescribed by the magistrate.\""
