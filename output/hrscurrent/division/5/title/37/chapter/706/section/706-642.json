[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; am L 1980, c 50, \u00a73; am L 1986, c 226, \u00a72; am L 2016, c 231, \u00a724]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7706-642\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 This section merely gives the court specific statutory authorization for two common sentencing practices:\u00a0 (1) installment payments of a fine, and (2) making a fine one of the conditions of continued probation.\n\u00a0\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON \u00a7706-642\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Act 50, Session Laws 1980, authorized the payment of fines by credit cards in recognition of the widespread use of credit cards and to enable the courts to take advantage of an efficient system of collection.\n\u00a0 Act 226, Session Laws 1986, ensured that, in cases where both fines and restitution are imposed, the latter has priority; no fine is to be collected until the restitution order is satisfied.\u00a0 In enacting this change, the legislature stated that it \"supports the concept of restitution as a valuable means of compensating losses incurred by victims and confronting the offender with the direct personal consequences of the crime.\"\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 798-86.\n\u00a0 Act 231, Session Laws 2016, amended subsection (3) to implement recommendations made by the Penal Code Review Committee convened pursuant to House Concurrent Resolution No. 155, S.D. 1 (2015).\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Where defendant was sentenced pursuant to \u00a7431:10C-117(a)(2), because the district court may have been unaware of the applicability of quoted parts of \u00a7706-641 and this section and of its discretionary authority to sentence defendant to perform community service rather than to pay the fine, appellate court vacated the part of the sentence ordering defendant to pay a $1,000 fine and remanded that part for resentencing.\u00a0 77 H. 476 (App.), 888 P.2d 376 (1995)."
