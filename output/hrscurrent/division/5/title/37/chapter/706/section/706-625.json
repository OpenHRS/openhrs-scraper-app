\u00a712]\n\u00a0\nNote\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Section 712-1240.6 referred to in text is repealed.\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7706-625\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 This section restates prior law[1] and allows the court to increase or relax the conditions of probation.\u00a0 Such power is essential if the disposition is to remain flexible.\u00a0 However, if an increase in the severity of the conditions is proposed, the court must accord the defendant the procedural rights stated in \u00a7706-627.\n\u00a0\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON \u00a7706-625\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Act 192, Session Laws 1985, amended this section and consolidated it with the law governing the revocation of probation or suspension of sentence, formerly contained in \u00a7706-628 and part of \u00a7706-627.\u00a0 As a result, \u00a7706-628 is repealed.\n\u00a0 Act 45, Session Laws 1989, defined the word \"conviction\" as applied in the revocation or modification of probation conditions.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1282, House Standing Committee Report No. 844.\n\u00a0 Act 5, Session Laws 1994, amended this section by changing the subsection designations from letters to numbers for the purpose of consistency in the Hawaii Penal Code.\u00a0 Subsection references throughout the Penal Code are designated by numbers rather than letters.\u00a0 House Standing Committee Report No. 329-94, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2638.\n\u00a0 Act 161, Session Laws 2002, amended this section to require the court not to revoke probation for the first violation of a nonviolent drug-related probation condition, and to require that the probation violators be sentenced to undergo and complete drug treatment instead of incarceration.\u00a0 The legislature found that the link between substance abuse and crime is well-established.\u00a0 The legislature did not wish to diminish the seriousness of crime, but looked to approaching crime as being the result of addiction that is treatable.\u00a0 The treatment route was expected to produce a reduction in crime and recidivism.\u00a0 The legislature intended to promote treatment of nonviolent substance abuse offenders, rather than incarceration, as being in the best interests of the individual and the community at large.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 96-02.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Criteria for modification.\u00a0 55 H. 632, 525 P.2d 1119 (1974).\n\u00a0 Mandated revocation of probation under certain circumstances is a means to compel a court to review defendant's original sentence in light of new facts.\u00a0 Court may reimpose the same sentence.\u00a0 69 H. 424, 744 P.2d 1208 (1987).\n\u00a0 Defendant was prejudiced because of inability to independently test urine samples.\u00a0 70 H. 194, 767 P.2d 243 (1989).\n\u00a0 Court had discretion to consider factors other than defendant's wilfulness in determining whether failure to comply with probation condition was inexcusable under section.\u00a0 73 H. 81, 829 P.2d 1325 (1992).\n\u00a0 Statutory language of subsection (e) (1992) must be harmonized with \u00a7706-671(2), mandating credit for time served in imprisonment.\u00a0 78 H. 343, 893 P.2d 194 (1995).\n\u00a0 Court abused discretion in revoking defendant's probation where defendant made the monthly payments as condition of probation and there was no other justifiable cause for revocation.\u00a0 79 H. 511, 904 P.2d 525 (1995).\n\u00a0 Subsection (5), which permits a trial court on revocation of probation to impose any sentence that might have originally been imposed at the time of conviction, does not apply to the sentencing procedure attendant to revocation of a deferred acceptance of guilty plea, which is already specifically governed by \u00a7853-3.\u00a0 93 H. 362, 3 P.3d 1239 (2000).\n\u00a0 Where petitioner lacked \"written notice\" that probation revocation was sought because petitioner was a high risk to commit another offense, and petitioner was not notified of the \"evidence\" of other sexual assaults that was used \"against\" petitioner in seeking revocation, petitioner's due process rights were violated.\u00a0 125 H. 114, 254 P.3d 425 (2011).\n\u00a0 Consistent with subsection (1), because petitioner, who was sentenced to probation under \u00a7706-622.5(1), had completed petitioner's probation term and was subsequently discharged and thus \"satisfied the disposition of the court\", as provided by \u00a7706-630, petitioner had, in effect, complied with the terms and conditions of probation for purposes of expungement under \u00a7706-622.5(4).\u00a0 129 H. 363, 300 P.3d 1022 (2013).\n\u00a0 For purposes of determining whether a defendant has inexcusably failed to comply with a substantial requirement imposed as a condition of a probation order, courts should consider (1) whether the defendant's actions were intentional; and (2) whether the defendant's actions, if intentional, were a deliberate attempt to circumvent the court's probation order, considering the goals of sentencing the defendant to probation.\u00a0 132 H. 209, 320 P.3d 874 (2014).\n\u00a0 In probation modification or revocation hearings, courts should apply a \"good cause\" standard for determining whether a continuance should be granted; family court abused its discretion in denying defendant's request for a continuance, where defendant had \"good cause\" for requesting a continuance and the court's error in failing to grant a continuance was not harmless.\u00a0 132 H. 209, 320 P.3d 874 (2014).\n\u00a0 Court cannot revoke probation and impose new probation term.\u00a0 6 H. App. 253, 718 P.2d 1117 (1986).\n\u00a0 Where defendant made conscious and wilful decision to fail to comply with a substantial requirement imposed as a condition of probation under subsection (3), court did not abuse discretion in revoking probation and imposing sentence which may have been originally imposed.\u00a0 82 H. 441 (App.), 922 P.2d 1054 (1996).\n\u00a0 Circuit court properly concluded that it was required to revoke defendant's probation pursuant to subsection (c) because of subsequent felony conviction.\u00a0 83 H. 102 (App.), 924 P.2d 596 (1996).\n\u00a0 When defendant refused to admit having committed the sex crimes and failed to pass the lie detector tests, defendant did not \"inexcusably\" fail to comply with a substantial requirement imposed as a condition of the probation order under subsection (3) as the trial court could not order defendant to admit defendant's sex crimes and defendant did not personally expressly and explicitly agree to admit defendant's sex crimes and to accept probation on that basis.\u00a0 93 H. 321 (App.), 2 P.3d 725 (2000).\n\u00a0 Upon revocation of probation pursuant to subsection (3), in light of the record, \u00a7\u00a7706-660 and 706-621, trial court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing defendant to imprisonment \"for a term of not more than ten years with credit for time served\".\u00a0 97 H. 135 (App.), 34 P.3d 1034 (2001).\n\u00a0 Where defendant failed to submit to drug/alcohol assessments, failed to report to defendant's probation officer, failed to notify probation officer of a change in address, and failed to pay the crime victim compensation and probation service fees, these violations of defendant's terms and conditions of probation did not involve the possession or use of drugs as meant under subsection (7); thus, trial court erred in its interpretation and application of this subsection.\u00a0 112 H. 208 (App.), 145 P.3d 751 (2006).\n\u00a0 Criminal contempt of court under \u00a7710-1077 is not available as a sanction for a violation of a condition of probation as there is no provision in this chapter that authorizes the use of criminal contempt as a sanction for violation of a condition of probation; the exclusive sanctions for a violation of a condition of probation in this chapter are set forth in this section.\u00a0 120 H. 312 (App.), 205 P.3d 577 (2009).\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n_______________\n\u00a7706-625 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 H.R.S. \u00a7711-77."
