Rev. 63 (2001).\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Murder contract not element of offense of murder; only relevant for purpose of sentence enhancement.\u00a0 807 F.2d 805 (1987).\n\u00a0 Not unconstitutionally vague.\u00a0 751 F. Supp. 853 (1990).\n\u00a0 The better rule is to include in indictment the aggravating circumstances which result in application of statute enhancing the penalty for the crime committed.\u00a0 59 H. 625, 586 P.2d 250 (1978).\n\u00a0 Subsection (b) not unconstitutional.\u00a0 Judge must impose sentence of life imprisonment with possibility of parole, but allowed to reduce it to twenty years if factors or circumstances warrant lesser sentence.\u00a0 64 H. 193, 638 P.2d 307 (1981).\n\u00a0 Sentencing court abused discretion by finding defendant committed murder by hire.\u00a0 67 H. 573, 698 P.2d 287 (1985).\n\u00a0 Trial court abused its discretion in rigidly applying family court sentencing guidelines promulgated without legislative authority.\u00a0 72 H. 521, 824 P.2d 837 (1992).\n\u00a0 Sentencing court may properly consider criminal convictions that occurred subsequent to original illegal sentence when applying \u00a7706-606 factors on resentencing.\u00a0 79 H. 281, 901 P.2d 481 (1995).\n\u00a0 Where no evidence that group engaged in or endorsed illegal activities, insufficient evidence to establish any reasonable correlation between defendant's association with group and imposition of consecutive prison sentences under paragraph (1).\u00a0 81 H. 309, 916 P.2d 1210 (1996).\n\u00a0 No abuse of discretion in court sentencing defendant to extended terms of imprisonment under \u00a7\u00a7706-661 and 706-662 where, inter alia, court considered each of the factors enumerated in this section and all the mitigating factors raised by defendant.\u00a0 83 H. 335, 926 P.2d 1258 (1996).\n\u00a0\u00a0The January 1, 1987 repeal of language in subsection (b) (pre-1986 amendment) authorizing a court to impose a sentence of life imprisonment with the possibility of parole for murder in cases other than described in subsection (a) (pre-1986 amendment) did not invalidate any such sentence imposed prior to the repeal date.\u00a0 102 H. 282, 75 P.3d 1173 (2003).\n\u00a0 A sentencing court may not impose discretionary conditions of probation pursuant to \u00a7706-624(2) unless there is a factual basis in the record indicating that such conditions \"are reasonably related to the factors set forth in this section\" and insofar as such \"conditions involve only deprivations of liberty or property\", that they are reasonably necessary for the purposes indicated in paragraph (2).\u00a0 103 H. 462, 83 P.3d 725 (2004).\n\u00a0 The circuit court's statement regarding defendant's \"extensive criminality\": \u00a0(1) related directly to the history and characteristics of the defendant and identified the specific facts or circumstances within the range of statutory factors that the court considered in imposing a consecutive sentence; and (2) provided the conclusions drawn by the court after consideration of all the facts that pertain to the statutory factors, and confirmed for defendant, the public, and the court that the decision to impose consecutive sentences was deliberate, rational, and fair.\u00a0 131 H. 94, 315 P.3d 720 (2013).\n\u00a0 Where the determination by the intermediate court of appeals (ICA) that the circuit court, in imposing a consecutive sentence, \"likely concluded\" that defendant was dangerous to the safety of the public or posed an unacceptable risk of re-offending, and that rehabilitation appeared unlikely, arguably could be read as speculating as to the circuit court's reasoning, it appeared that the ICA was rather attempting to link the circuit court's express reasoning to the examples in State v. Hussein, and to the extent doing so constituted error by the ICA, the error did not warrant vacating defendant's convictions.\u00a0 131 H. 94, 315 P.3d 720 (2013).\n\u00a0 Seven-day term of imprisonment was not unreasonably related to factors set forth in this section, considering nature of offense and circumstances presented by the record.\u00a0 10 H. App. 381, 876 P.2d 1331 (1994).\n\u00a0 Trial court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing defendant to consecutive terms of imprisonment under \u00a7706-668.5 where, taking into consideration all of the factors set forth in this section, the court pointed to the high level of cruelty, violence, and viciousness involved in the commission of the offenses, that most of the offenses took place in front of defendant's two-year-old son, defendant's lack of remorse, the clear and present danger defendant posed to complainant and the community, and the poor prospects for defendant's rehabilitation.\u00a0 106 H. 365 (App.), 105 P.3d 242 (2004).\n\u00a0 Where trial court's rationale for imposing jail time reflected the factors listed in this section, and the jail time imposed did not exceed the maximum jail term authorized by \u00a7706-663, trial court did not clearly exceed the bounds of reason nor disregard rules or principles of law or practice to defendant's substantial detriment in imposing a jail term; thus, trial court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing defendant to 120 days' imprisonment.\u00a0 116 H. 403 (App.), 173 P.3d 550 (2007).\n\u00a0 Family court did not abuse its discretion by requiring defendant to attend domestic violence counseling as a condition of defendant's probation; where defendant was charged with endangering the welfare of an incompetent person under \u00a7709-905 based on substantial evidence that defendant assaulted complainant, under \u00a7706-624(2), the court was free to impose discretionary conditions of probation that are reasonably related to the factors set forth in this section and to the extent that the conditions involve only deprivations of liberty as are reasonably necessary for the purposes indicated in paragraph (2).\u00a0 121 H. 228 (App.), 216 P.3d 1251 (2009).\n\u00a0 Court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing defendant to consecutive terms of imprisonment under \u00a7706-668.5 because it considered the factors set forth in this section; defendant's extensive record and the fact that defendant caused a lot of harm in the community were specific circumstances that led the court to conclude that a consecutive sentence was appropriate.\u00a0 129 H. 135 (App.), 295 P.3d 1005 (2013).\n\u00a0 Cited: 73 H. 81, 829 P.2d 1325 (1992).\n\u00a0 Discussed:\u00a0 78 H. 127, 890 P.2d 1167 (1995); 81 H. 421 (App.), 918 P.2d 228 (1996)."
