Alabama, 132 S. Ct. 2455 (2012), the U.S. Supreme Court held that mandatory life sentences without parole for those under the age of eighteen at the time of their crimes violate the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishments.\u00a0 The legislature also recognized that mitigating factors may exist for cases involving a juvenile offender.\u00a0 In Miller, the Supreme Court stated that youth is a moment and \"condition of life when a person may be most susceptible to influence and to psychological damage.\"\u00a0 Therefore, the legislature encouraged the sentencing judge to take into account and consider any mitigating factors for cases involving a juvenile offender.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3248, Conference Committee Report No. 56-14.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 For sentencing purposes, conspiracy to commit second degree murder is a class C felony under \u00a7706-610 and subject to the sentencing provisions of \u00a7706-660, not this section.\u00a0 84 H. 280, 933 P.2d 617 (1997).\n\u00a0 Sentence for murder not an extended term.\u00a0 6 H.
