[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; am L 1986, c 314, \u00a728; am L 1989, c 125, \u00a71; am L 2001, c 24, \u00a71 and c 91, \u00a74]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7706-626\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 The court, in order to control the conditions of suspension or probation, must have power, either by summons or warrant, to require the defendant to appear before the court.\u00a0 Subsection (1) provides this power.\u00a0 Subsection (2) provides a more limited power for probation and peace officers; they may arrest without a warrant only where there is probable cause to believe that the defendant has failed to comply with a condition of probation or suspension.\n\u00a0 Subsection (3) is addressed to the problem presented by a defendant who is on probation or under suspended sentence and who is accused or charged with commission of another crime.\u00a0 The commission of a crime while on probation or under suspension of sentence would, in most cases, constitute a violation of a condition of probation or suspension.\u00a0 The question thus presented is whether the issue of guilt, with respect to the most recent crime, should be tried informally as a violation of a condition of suspension or probation or whether the issue should be tried independently.\u00a0 The Code resolves this question by providing that the defendant may be held pending an independent or formal determination by the court having jurisdiction over the charge, thus preserving for the defendant all procedural rights.\u00a0 This subsection must be read in conjunction with \u00a7706-628(1) which provides for revocation in cases where the defendant \"has been convicted of another crime.\"\n\u00a0 Subsection (1) is in substantial accord with prior law governing the circuit courts.[1]\u00a0 Subsection (2) is an addition to the law and subsection (3) represents a slight departure from it.\u00a0 The circuit court apparently had the power--although it may choose not to exercise it--to decide, in a probation proceeding, the issue of whether the defendant has committed a crime during the period of probation.[2]\n\u00a0\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON \u00a7706-626\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Act 125, Session Laws 1989, required that a probationer be placed in custody after arrest for a probation violation and permitted an arrested probationer to post bail in certain circumstances.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1331.\n\u00a0 Act 24, Session Laws 2001, amended this section to authorize probation or peace officers to admit defendants to bail when the punishment for the original offense does not exceed one year.\u00a0 Although law enforcement personnel may set bail for petty misdemeanor and misdemeanor offenses, they are not authorized to do so for probation violators and must defer to the courts.\u00a0 The legislature found that the ability to immediately arrest and set bail for petty misdemeanor and misdemeanor probationers would allow more efficient processing of probation violations.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1516, House Standing Committee Report No. 547.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Subsection (3) should not be read to mean that statutes on probation are concerned only with offenses committed after a defendant is placed on probation.\u00a0 Implications arising from this section and commentary cannot be used to define language of \u00a7706-628(1).\u00a0 62 H. 159, 612 P.2d 1168 (1980).\n\u00a0 Evidentiary requirements of subsection (3), satisfaction of.\u00a0 1 H. App. 98, 614 P.2d 405 (1980).\n\u00a0 Under subsection (3), upon showing of probable cause court has discretionary authority to commit without bail.\u00a0 1 H. App. 98, 614 P.2d 405 (1980).\n\u00a0 Motion to commit without bail pursuant to subsection (3) tolls the period of probation.\u00a0 1 H. App. 469, 620 P.2d 1082 (1980).\n\u00a0 Period of probation which had been tolled begins to run again after written entry of judgment.\u00a0 4 H. App. 35, 658 P.2d 910 (1983).\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7706-626 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 See H.R.S. \u00a7711-80.\n\u00a0\n2.\u00a0 Id."
