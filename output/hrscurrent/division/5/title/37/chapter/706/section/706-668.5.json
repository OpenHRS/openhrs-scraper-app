Kumukau:\u00a0 A Case for the Application of Eighth Amendment Proportionality Analysis.\u00a0 13 UH L. Rev. 577 (1991).\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Statute (pre-2008) discussed, where defendants' motion for partial summary judgment was granted as to counts alleging violations of the state constitution and negligence, but was otherwise denied, in a 42 U.S.C. \u00a71983 civil rights lawsuit brought by a former state prisoner and other allegedly similarly-situated plaintiffs primarily seeking damages for \"over detention\".\u00a0 678 F. Supp. 2d 1061 (2010).\n\u00a0 Sentencing court's imposition of consecutive prison terms pursuant to this section constituted an abuse of discretion, where court's sole purpose in imposing consecutive terms was to maximize the supervisory power of the Hawaii paroling authority over defendant in an attempt to facilitate the collection of court-ordered restitution. \u00a078 H. 127, 890 P.2d 1167 (1995).\n\u00a0 Sentencing court did not abuse its discretion in resentencing appellant to consecutive terms of imprisonment.\u00a0 79 H. 281, 901 P.2d 481 (1995).\n\u00a0 Extraordinarily sadistic and cruel manner in which defendant committed offenses and defendant's past behavioral history required retributive, incapacitative and deterrent penal objectives of consecutive terms of imprisonment achieved under this section.\u00a0 83 H. 335, 926 P.2d 1258 (1996).\n\u00a0 Trial court plainly erred in sentencing defendant to consecutive terms of imprisonment based on the unsubstantiated allegation that defendant had transferred a semi-automatic firearm to a drug dealer.\u00a0 106 H. 441, 106 P.3d 364 (2005).\n\u00a0 Where defendant was convicted by the jury of five first-degree thefts, each of which defendant was sentenced to ten years' incarceration, and pursuant to \u00a7706-660 and this section, five ten-year terms running consecutively was the statutory maximum, defendant's sentence did not deprive defendant of defendant's right to a jury trial as interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court in Apprendi and Blakely.\u00a0 111 H. 267, 141 P.3d 440 (2006).\n\u00a0 Imposing a prison sentence consecutively to \"any sentence\" pursuant to \u00a7706-606.5(5), including the lesser of such sentences, is a novel, but accurate view of the statute; thus, henceforth, the circuit court must state on the record its reasons for imposing a consecutive as opposed to a concurrent sentence under \u00a7706-606.5 or this section.\u00a0 122 H. 495, 229 P.3d 313 (2010).\n\u00a0 The circuit court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing defendant to consecutive terms of imprisonment based on defendant's \"extensive criminality\".\u00a0 131 H. 94, 315 P.3d 720 (2013).\n\u00a0 Trial court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing defendant to consecutive terms of imprisonment under this section where, taking into consideration all of the factors set forth in \u00a7706-606, the court pointed to the high level of cruelty, violence, and viciousness involved in the commission of the offenses, that most of the offenses took place in front of defendant's two-year-old son, defendant's lack of remorse, the clear and present danger defendant posed to complainant and the community, and the poor prospects for defendant's rehabilitation.\u00a0 106 H. 365 (App.), 105 P.3d 242 (2004).\n\u00a0 Court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing defendant to consecutive terms of imprisonment under this section because it considered the factors set forth in \u00a7706-606; defendant's extensive record and the fact that defendant caused a lot of harm in the community were specific circumstances that led the court to conclude that a consecutive sentence was appropriate.\u00a0 129 H. 135 (App.), 295 P.3d 1005 (2013).\n\u00a0 Discussed:\u00a0 81 H. 421 (App.), 918 P.2d 228 (1996)."
