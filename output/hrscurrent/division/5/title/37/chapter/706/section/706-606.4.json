[L 1999, c 268, \u00a72; am L 2003, c 3, \u00a716; am L 2016, c 157, \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7706-606.4\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Act 268, Session Laws 1999, added this section to require judges, when imposing a sentence, to consider the fact that the crime was committed in the presence of a minor as an aggravating factor of the crime; the court shall consider the aggravating factors in addition to the factors to be considered under \u00a7706-606.\u00a0 The legislature found that children who witness domestic violence are harmed in many ways, and acknowledged that domestic violence is a perpetuation of a violent cycle, as children of abuse grow up to be abusers themselves.\u00a0 Studies have documented multiple problems among children that have witnessed continual assaults by one parent on another in the home, including psychological and emotional distress, cognitive functioning problems, and physical problems.\u00a0 Because of the high social and financial costs resulting from domestic violence, the legislature agreed that more serious penalties should be imposed for both their deterrent and punitive effects.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 26.\n\u00a0 Act 3, Session Laws 2003, made a technical amendment to this section, by deleting the brackets around the word \"or\" in the phrase \"abuse of family or household members.\"\n\u00a0 Act 157, Session Laws 2016, amended this section to provide that the commission of certain offenses of assault, sexual assault, and abuse of a family or household member in the presence of a minor is an aggravating factor to be considered in the sentencing of the defendant convicted of the offense.\u00a0 The legislature found that research has shown that children who witness assault or domestic violence can suffer severe emotional and developmental difficulties that are similar to those of children who are victims of direct physical and mental abuse.\u00a0 By broadening the application of the aggravating factor considered by the courts when sentencing defendants convicted of committing certain crimes in the presence of a minor pursuant to this section to include the commission of assault and sexual assault offenses regardless of the preexisting legal relationship between the defendant and the victim or the child, Act 157 recognized the impact that witnessing an assault has on a child.\u00a0 The use of the aggravating factor for sentencing does not elevate the seriousness of the offense charged.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 13-16."
