[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; am L 1977, c 106, \u00a71; am L 1980, c 156, \u00a71; am L 1985, c 192, \u00a72; am L 1986, c 314, \u00a729]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7706-627\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 This section affords the defendant threatened with loss or change of suspension or probation status the same procedural protection afforded a defendant at the time of original disposition.[1]\u00a0 Determinations to revoke suspension or probation, or to change the conditions thereof, are sometimes made with a degree of informality that does not afford to the defendant adequate opportunity to obtain counsel and to be heard upon the evidence.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This is an area where dangers of abuse are real and the normal procedural protection proper.\u00a0 That a defendant has no right to suspension or probation does not justify the alteration of his status by methods that must seem and sometimes be unfair.[2]\nAlthough written notice, the right to be represented by counsel, and the right to controvert and be heard upon the evidence, are provided by this section, it is not contemplated that the court must strictly enforce the rules of evidence.\u00a0 In this type of hearing, where the relevant issues are decided by a court without the presence of a jury, the court should be granted some flexibility in this area.\n\u00a0 Act 106, Session Laws 1977, added subsections (2) and (3) to provide for tolling the period of probation or suspension of sentence pending the hearing to revoke the probation or suspension or to increase the conditions thereof.\u00a0 Formerly, with no tolling provisions, it was possible for the period of probation or suspended sentence to run out before termination of the hearing, relieving defendant of any further obligation even though the defendant may have committed acts justifying change in the defendant's probation or suspension status.\u00a0 The amended section is intended to prevent such situations from occurring.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1105, House Standing Committee Report No. 450.\n\u00a0 Act 156, Session Laws 1980, made the granting of the period of tolling discretionary rather than mandatory.\u00a0 The legislature felt that the prior law gave the defendants an unfair advantage by allowing them \"credit\" on their sentence even while they were not abiding by its terms.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 753-80, House Standing Committee Report No. 434-80.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 The tolling provisions under this section apply to deferral periods pursuant to a deferred acceptance of guilty plea under \u00a7853-1.\u00a0 92 H. 322, 991 P.2d 832 (2000).\n\u00a0 Where State did not file a written motion to revoke defendant's deferred acceptance of guilty plea, the probationary period was not tolled; thus, as the deferment period had expired two months earlier, trial court lacked jurisdiction to revoke defendant's deferred acceptance of guilty plea.\u00a0 118 H. 15, 185 P.3d 200 (2008).\n\u00a0 Filing motion under subsection (2) is not the only method of tolling period of probation; motion under \u00a7706-626(3) also tolls period.\u00a0 1 H. App. 469, 620 P.2d 1082 (1980).\n\u00a0 Mentioned:\u00a0 55 H. 632, 525 P.2d 1119 (1974).\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7706-627 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 Cf. \u00a7706-604.\n\u00a0\n2.\u00a0 M.P.C., Tentative Draft No. 2, comments at 152 (1954)."
