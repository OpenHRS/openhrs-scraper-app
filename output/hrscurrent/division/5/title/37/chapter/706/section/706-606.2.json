The court lacked guidance as to the costs the court could require an arsonist to pay for starting a brush fire.\u00a0 The legislature found that the Act was just, would reduce the counties' financial burden incurred for firefighting expenses, and would serve as a deterrent to those who would commit arson.\u00a0 House Standing Committee Report No. 1522-08, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2557."
