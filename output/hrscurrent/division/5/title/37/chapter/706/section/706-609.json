[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7706-609\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 This section is derived from the American Bar Association's Standards Relating to Sentencing Alternatives and Procedures.[1]\u00a0 The section is self-explanatory.\u00a0 The reasons which compelled the American Bar Association Project to recommend this section have been well stated in the commentary to the Standards.\u00a0 We yield to the temptation to quote that commentary at length: \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There are three reasons which have led the Advisory Committee to this view.\u00a0 The first relates to the selection process which leads to the possibility of an increased sentence.\u00a0 The only argument which can justify an increase following a re-trial is that the original sentence was too light, either because the first judge was too lenient or because new facts have been presented.\u00a0 However, the only class of persons who are vulnerable to this argument consists of those who have exercised the right to challenge their convictions.\u00a0 There is no basis for believing that there exists any rational correspondence between this group and those offenders who may indeed deserve an increase.... \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The second argument is closely related.\u00a0 The risk of a greater sentence as the result of the assertion of the right of review necessarily acts as a deterrent to the exercise of the right.\u00a0 The issue thus posed is whether this is a desirable result.\u00a0 The Advisory Committee believes that it is not.\u00a0 The extent of the pressure placed on an individual defendant bears no relation to the degree of injustice which may have been perpetrated.\u00a0 A system which fears the assertion of error to a degree that it must place artificial deterrents in the path which leads to review is not a healthy system.\u00a0 There can also be adverse effects on the rehabilitative effort of the individual defendant who believes that he was wronged but is told that he may have to subject himself to the possibility of a greater wrong in order to assert any error. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The third reason which leads the Advisory Committee to this view begins with the difficulties which a contrary position would invite.\u00a0 It is a matter of record that some judges have imposed harsher sentences because of lack of sympathy with the constitutional rights asserted by some defendants, and in a frank attempt to minimize the numbers who will assert such rights in the future.\u00a0 Yet it is at least clear that greater punishment should not be inflicted on the defendant because he has asserted his right to appeal.\u00a0 The only justification for an increased sentence, as noted above, is either that the first judge was too lenient or that new facts have been discovered.\u00a0 A position contrary to the standard proposed here would thus necessitate in every case a factual inquiry to determine the motivation of the judge who imposed the new sentence.\u00a0 As the Fourth Circuit recently pointed out, it is \"impossible, and most distasteful\" for other courts to be required to make that kind of inquiry.\u00a0 Patton v. North Carolina, 381 F.2d 636, 641 (4th Cir. 1967).\u00a0 If the system can avoid such a result at a cost which is not prohibitive, it most certainly should do so.\u00a0 In the Advisory Committee's view, the cost in this instance particularly in light of the other reasons advanced above is not significant. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, it should also be noted that there are substantial constitutional arguments which can be made against a practice contrary to the proposed standard.\u00a0 The First and Fourth Circuits have recently held an increased sentence after a re-trial to be unconstitutional.\u00a0 See Marano v. United States, 374 F.2d 583 (1st Cir. 1967); Patton v. North Carolina, 381 F.2d 636 (4th Cir. 1967).\u00a0 The Third Circuit has disagreed.\u00a0 See United States ex rel. Starner v. Russell, 378 F.2d 808 (3d Cir. 1967), cert. denied, 36 U.S. Law Week 3148 (Oct. 9, 1967)....[2] \n\u00a0 The Code finds the reasoning of the commentary to the Standards persuasive and accordingly, in this section, accepts the recommendation purposed.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Section inapplicable to cases where a new sentence, which is not more severe than a prior sentence, adversely affects a defendant's parole status.\u00a0 79 H. 281, 901 P.2d 481 (1995).\n\u00a0 This section applies to a situation where the first sentence was imposed after a trial and the second sentence was imposed after a retrial, or, where the first sentence was imposed after an unbargained plea and the second sentence was imposed after a trial.\u00a0 102 H. 346 (App.), 76 P.3d 589 (2003).\n\u00a0 Section does not directly apply to the Hawaii paroling authority's setting of a defendant's minimum term of incarceration.\u00a0 126 H. 555 (App.), 273 P.3d 1241 (2012).\n\u00a0 Discussed:\u00a0 83 H. 507, 928 P.2d 1 (1996).\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7706-609 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 A.B.A. Standards. \n\u00a0\n2.\u00a0 Id.\u00a0 Comments at 198-200."
