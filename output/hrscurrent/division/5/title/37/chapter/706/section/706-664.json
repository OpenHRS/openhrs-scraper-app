[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; am L 1986, c 314, \u00a742; gen ch 1992; am L Sp 2007 2d, c 1, \u00a74]\n\u00a0\nApplicability of Act 1, Second Special Session of 2007\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 L Sp 2007 2d, c 1, \u00a75 provides:\n\u00a0 \"SECTION 5.\u00a0 This Act shall apply to all sentencing or resentencing proceedings pending on or commenced after the effective date of this Act [October 31, 2007], whether the offense was committed prior to, on, or after the effective date of this Act [October 31, 2007].\u00a0 A defendant whose extended term of imprisonment is set aside or invalidated shall be resentenced pursuant to this Act upon request of the prosecutor.\u00a0 This Act shall not entitle a defendant who has previously been sentenced to an extended term to be resentenced pursuant to the procedures set forth in this Act unless the defendant is otherwise legally entitled to be resentenced.\"\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7706-664\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 This section sets forth the procedure when the court has before it a motion in favor of sentencing the defendant to imprisonment for an extended term.\u00a0 Fairness to the defendant demands that the defendant receive notice of the ground upon which an extended term is proposed and that the hearing focus on this issue.\u00a0 In other respects the hearing will be the same as that provided for in cases involving the possibility of imprisonment within the ordinary limits.\n\u00a0\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON \u00a7706-664\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Act 1, Second Special Session Laws 2007, amended this section and other extended sentencing statutes (\u00a7\u00a7706-661 and 706-662) to ensure that the procedures used to impose extended terms of imprisonment comply with the requirements of the United States Supreme Court and the Hawaii supreme court.\u00a0 Act 1 required that a jury determine the facts necessary to impose an extended term of imprisonment, unless the defendant waives the right to a jury determination, and that facts necessary to impose an extended term of imprisonment are proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u00a0 The legislature found that Hawaii's current extended sentencing procedure had been deemed unconstitutional because a judge, rather than a jury, was required to find facts, other than those of prior or concurrent convictions, necessary to enhance a defendant's sentence beyond the ordinary or standard term authorized by the jury's verdict.\u00a0 Act 1's amendments conformed the State's enhanced sentencing law to the requirements of the United States Supreme Court and the Hawaii supreme court.\u00a0 Act 1 applied retroactively to sentencing or resentencing proceedings that were pending on or commenced after its effective date [October 31, 2007], whether the offense was committed prior to, on, or after that date.\u00a0 However, the Act did not entitle a defendant who was previously sentenced to an extended term of imprisonment to resentencing pursuant to the procedures set forth in the Act, unless the defendant was otherwise legally entitled to be resentenced.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 7, House Standing Committee Report No. 1.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Question as to proper procedure for making finding of multiple offender raised but not decided.\u00a0 56 H. 32, 526 P.2d 1200 (1974).\n\u00a0 Independent hearing with full procedural due process.\u00a0 56 H. 628, 548 P.2d 632 (1976).\n\u00a0 Notice of hearing may issue from court without help from prosecutor.\u00a0 60 H. 93, 588 P.2d 412 (1978).\n\u00a0 The court may properly initiate extended term hearings, notwithstanding inaction by prosecutor.\u00a0 60 H. 100, 588 P.2d 409 (1978).\n\u00a0 Notice adequate under circumstances.\u00a0 63 H. 488, 630 P.2d 619 (1981).\n\u00a0 The constitutional prohibition against ex post facto measures was not offended by the plain language of Act 1, L Sp 2007 2d, amending \u00a7\u00a7706-661, 706-662, and this section regarding sentencing or resentencing for extended terms of imprisonment, where it was clear that the new jury provisions did not (1) increase criminal liability for conduct previously innocent, (2) aggravate the degree of defendant's crimes, (3) increase the punishment available at the time defendant committed defendant's crimes, or (4) alter evidentiary standards to defendant's detriment.\u00a0 117 H. 381, 184 P.3d 133 (2008).\n\u00a0 The constitutional prohibition against ex post facto measures was not offended by the retrospective application to defendant of Act 1, L Sp 2007 2d, amending \u00a7\u00a7706-661, 706-662, and this section, where Act 1 did not punish as a crime an act previously committed which was innocent when done, make more burdensome the punishment for the crime after its commission, nor deprive one charged with the crime of any defense available according to the law when the act was committed.\u00a0 118 H. 68 (App.), 185 P.3d 816 (2008)."
