[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7706-607\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 This section extends the concept of involuntary hospitalization in the penal context beyond its classic use in cases of irresponsible defendants.[1]\u00a0 The section does not itself create the authority for the involuntary hospitalization of certain types of offenders, but rather it acknowledges that where the defendant is subject by law to involuntary hospitalization, the court may order the hospitalization in lieu of prosecution or sentence.\u00a0 In the terminology of the Model Penal Code:\n\u00a0 This section does not authorize civil commitment in any case but rather pre-supposes that authority for the commitment is otherwise conferred by law.\u00a0 Only in that event is the commitment authorized in lieu of sentence.[2]\n\u00a0 The Code allows the court, in its discretion, to order hospitalization in three limited situations: where a person prosecuted for a class C felony or lesser grade of crime is (1) a chronic alcoholic, (2) a narcotic addict, or (3) a person suffering from a mental abnormality not amounting to an excusing condition under chapter 704.\u00a0 The commitment in each case is to a medical institution for rehabilitative treatment.\n\u00a0 The section is in accord with the trend of the law favoring medical and para-medical incarceration rather than incarceration which is largely, but not solely, punitive.[3]\n\u00a0 It should be noted that the section is not restricted to crimes directly related to the defendant's physical or mental condition.\u00a0 Rather, the court is empowered to order hospitalization, if authorized by civil law, in cases where the crime is only tangentially related to the defendant's abnormality.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...[W]hen the method of subjecting narcotic users to treatment is commitment, it makes small sense to deny that authority if the addict is not guilty of possession merely but has also committed a larceny, for example, to find the means for getting his supply.[4]\nThe same example might be used in the case of chronic alcoholics.\n\u00a0 Subsection (2) provides a statutory guideline for the exercise of judicial discretion.\u00a0 The court should, of course, refrain from ordering civil commitment unless such commitment will substantially further the rehabilitation of the defendant without jeopardizing the protection of the public.\n\u00a0 Finally, it should be noted that this section is not a self-executing one.\u00a0 It does not solve the difficult problem of determining in what cases of physical or mental illness or abnormality involuntary hospitalization ought to be authorized.\u00a0 The resolution of that question can only result from a complete reevaluation of the laws authorizing involuntary hospitalization.\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7706-607 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 Cf.
