[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; am L 1986, c 314, \u00a723; gen ch 1992]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7706-622\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Once the decision has been made to withhold a sentence of imprisonment, some criteria must be stated for choosing between suspending sentence and sentencing the defendant to probation.\u00a0 The Code favors placing the defendant on probation if the defendant needs \"the supervision, guidance, assistance, or direction that the probation service can provide.\"\u00a0 In the case of defendants convicted of serious crimes, probation will be the usual sentence (if imprisonment is withheld).\u00a0 For those defendants convicted of minor crimes (especially first offenders), a suspended sentence may suffice."
