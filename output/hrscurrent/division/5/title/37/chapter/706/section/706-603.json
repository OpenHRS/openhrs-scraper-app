Supplemental Commentary on \u00a7\u00a7704-404, 411, and 414.)\n\u00a0 Act 3, Session Laws 1979, amended this section by providing for a three member examination panel (to be appointed in the same manner as the examination panels in \u00a7\u00a7704-404, 411, and 414) as the sole alternative to a single examiner.\u00a0 This was done to allow greater flexibility in appointing mental health professionals to the panels.\u00a0 Act 105 amended this section to restore language inadvertently deleted by Act 54, Session Laws 1974.\n\u00a0 Act 232, Session Laws 1980, amended this section to restore amendments made by Act 3, \u00a74, Session Laws 1979, which were superseded by Act 105, Session Laws 1979, under a general supersession clause.\n\u00a0 Act 314, Session Laws 1986, amended \"certified clinical psychologists\" to \"licensed psychologists.\"\u00a0 This change was made because psychologists are licensed and not certified and the term \"clinical\" does not accurately describe psychologists qualified to determine penal responsibility and fitness to proceed.\u00a0 Act 314 also provided an exception to the licensure requirement which recognizes that under \u00a7465-3(4), psychologists employed under government certification or civil service rules are exempt from the licensure requirement. \u00a0Conference Committee Report No. 51-86.\n\u00a0 Act 145, Session Laws 1987, permitted the department of health to set minimum standards for participation and appointment of a sanity examiner.\u00a0 The legislature felt this change would allow additional assurances of higher quality testimony by these examiners.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 691, House Standing Committee Report No. 1217.\n\u00a0 Act 231, Session Laws 1991, required the court to order a defendant convicted of a sexual offense, a violent crime, or the attempt of either, to submit to blood and saliva testing to be used for a DNA identification profile which will allow law enforcement officials to identify reoffenders.\u00a0 The legislature weighed the balance between the defendant's right to privacy and the needs of society, and found that the needs of society to deter sexual and violent crimes outweighed the defendant's right to privacy.\u00a0 House Standing Committee Report No. 1018.\n\u00a0 Act 271, Session Laws 1998, amended this section to require defendants convicted of sexual or violent offenses to provide blood samples for DNA analysis.\u00a0 The court is allowed to order convicted defendants to pay a monetary assessment of $500 or the actual cost of DNA analysis, whichever is less, to defray the costs of obtaining, storing, and testing the blood sample.\u00a0 Act 271 created a DNA registry special fund, administered by the attorney general, into which the monetary assessments are to be deposited.\u00a0 A person who negligently or recklessly fails to provide blood samples is guilty of a misdemeanor, and a person who intentionally or knowingly fails to provide blood samples is guilty of a class C felony.\n\u00a0 The legislature recognized that DNA information is an increasingly valuable tool for investigating, prosecuting, and defending criminal cases.\u00a0 The legislature found that the development of a DNA registry is important to protect the public from further criminal acts committed by the offenders, but that the cost of the DNA sampling process is borne by police departments without state funding.\u00a0 The legislature agreed that convicted defendants who are required to provide DNA samples should be assessed a fee to defray the costs of testing.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 110, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3009.\n\u00a0 Act 157, Session Laws 2001, amended this section, among others, to conform amendments relating to revocation of motor vehicle registrations under administrative revocation proceedings with the comprehensive law regarding driving under the influence which is to take effect on January 1, 2002.\u00a0 Act 157 conformed and consolidated the provisions of Act 189, Session Laws 2000, to existing law regarding driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, and suspension and revocation of licenses.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1406.\n\u00a0 Act 112, Session Laws 2005, established a statewide DNA database and data bank identification program for all convicted felons.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 184.\u00a0 Act 112 amended this section by deleting the provisions regarding blood samples for DNA analysis and by requiring every convicted felon to pay a monetary assessment of $500 or the actual cost of the DNA analysis, whichever is less.\n\u00a0 Act 231, Session Laws 2016, amended subsection (4) to implement recommendations made by the Penal Code Review Committee convened pursuant to House Concurrent Resolution No. 155, S.D. 1 (2015).\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Cited as authorizing a pre-sentence psychiatric examination.\u00a0 60 H. 100, 588 P.2d 409 (1978).\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7706-603 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 A.B.A. Standards, comments at 229.\n\u00a0\n2.\u00a0 Cf.
