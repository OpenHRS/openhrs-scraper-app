[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; am L 1986, c 314, \u00a719; am L 1987, c 181, \u00a74]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7706-610\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 The chapter takes the general position that authorized sentences must take into consideration two things:\u00a0 (1) the seriousness of the crime, and (2) the character of the defendant.\u00a0 The Penal Code divides crime into three grades--felonies, misdemeanors, and petty misdemeanors--according to their seriousness.\u00a0 This section further subdivides felonies into three classes.\u00a0 With the exception of special provisions calling for the possibility of lifetime imprisonment for the offense of murder, the Code thus provides five categories of crimes \"which should exhaust the possibilities of reasonable, legislative discrimination.\"[1]\n\u00a0 The prior Hawaii criminal law provided for two categories of crimes:\u00a0 felonies and misdemeanors.[2]\u00a0 However, within each category, the legislature had fixed a multitude of different sentences which are not necessarily consistent with one another or adequately correlated to the relative seriousness of the offense.[3]\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The number and variety of the distinctions of this order found in most existing systems is one of the main causes of the anarchy in sentencing that is so widely deplored.\u00a0 Any effort to rationalize the situation must result in the reduction of distinctions to a relatively few important categories.[4]\n\u00a0 Subsection (2) reduces to a class C felony, those felonies defined by a statute not within this Code.\u00a0 This reflects the \"judgment that the [Penal] Code should deal at least with any area of criminality involving crimes so serious that classification as a [class A or class B] felony for sentence purposes is justified.\"[5]\n\u00a0\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON \u00a7706-610\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Act 314, Session Laws 1986, amended this section so that non-Code statutes enacted since 1973 may designate felonies as class A or B felonies, rather than automatically being deemed class C felonies under present law.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 51-86.\n\u00a0 Act 181, Session Laws 1987, added language to this section to reflect the recently created statutory murder and attempted murder crimes.\u00a0 These crimes are murder in the first and second degree and attempted murder in the first and second degree.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1130.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Because criminal solicitation to commit first degree murder is a crime declared to be a felony without specification of class within meaning of this section, it is a class C felony for sentencing purposes, subject to the sentencing provisions of \u00a7706-660.\u00a0 84 H. 229, 933 P.2d 66 (1997).\n\u00a0 For sentencing purposes, conspiracy to commit second degree murder is a class C felony under this section and subject to the sentencing provisions of \u00a7706-660, not \u00a7706-656.\u00a0 84 H. 280, 933 P.2d 617 (1997).\n\u00a0 As an attempt to commit a crime is an offense of the same class and grade as the offense which is attempted, and second degree murder committed under the \"aggravated circumstances\" set forth in \u00a7706-660.2 is expressly distinguished from classified felonies and, pursuant to this section, from unclassified felonies thus, attempted second degree murder is not an \"unclassified\" offense for purposes of sentencing and is not treated as a class C felony pursuant to \u00a7706-660.2.\u00a0 96 H. 17, 25 P.3d 792 (2001).\n\u00a0 Section 291C-12 failure to stop offense committed prior to its 1992 amendment was outside of this code and constituted a class C felony for purposes of sentencing.\u00a0 9 H. App. 333, 839 P.2d 1186 (1992).\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7706-610 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 M.P.C., Tentative Draft No. 2, comments at 10 (1954).\n\u00a0\n2.\u00a0 H.R.S. \u00a7701-2.\n\u00a0\n3.\u00a0 Cf. commentary on \u00a7706-600.\n\u00a0\n4.\u00a0 M.P.C., Tentative Draft No. 2, comments at 10-11 (1954).\n\u00a0\n5.\u00a0 Id. at 11."
