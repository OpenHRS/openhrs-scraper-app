[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; am L 1986, c 314, \u00a734]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7706-641\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 This section states the general position of the Code against the routine imposition of fines where other types of disposition are authorized.\u00a0 Even in the case of violations, where only a fine or suspended sentence is authorized, the fine imposed should be measured in terms of the defendant's ability to pay and in terms of the defendant's ability to make compensation to the victims, if any, of the defendant's offense.\n\u00a0 Where other types of disposition are available, the court should not impose only a fine unless the court makes a determination that \"a fine alone suffices for the protection of the public.\"\n\u00a0 More is required of the court in order to impose both imprisonment and a fine or probation and a fine upon a defendant.\u00a0 The court is authorized by subsection (2) to impose such a sentence only if the defendant derived pecuniary gain from the crime or the court is of the opinion that a fine (in addition to imprisonment or probation) will serve either a correctional or deterrent function.\n\u00a0 Subsection (3)(a) seeks to eliminate fines which the defendant cannot pay.\u00a0 Incarceration should not result from mere inability to pay an imposed fine.\u00a0 Contumacious non-payment is quite another thing and is handled in subsequent sections.\u00a0 Subsection (3)(b) seeks to prevent the imposition of a fine which would interfere with restitution or reparation to the victim.\n\u00a0 Subsection (4) instructs the court to consider the defendant's financial resources with respect to the fine's amount and its method of payment (lump sum or installment payments).\n\u00a0 The Code differs from prior law in that it ends the possibility of imprisonment for noncontumacious failure to make payment.[1]\u00a0 It also supplies legislative guidelines previously absent from the law.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Where defendant was sentenced pursuant to \u00a7431:10C-117(a)(2), because the district court may have been unaware of the applicability of quoted parts of this section and \u00a7706-642 and of its discretionary authority to sentence defendant to perform community service rather than to pay the fine, appellate court vacated the part of the sentence ordering defendant to pay a $1,000 fine and remanded that part for resentencing.\u00a0 77 H. 476 (App.), 888 P.2d 376 (1995).\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7706-641 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 See H.R.S. \u00a7712-4."
