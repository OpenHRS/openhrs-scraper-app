New Jersey required a jury to make the finding.\u00a0 436 F.3d 1057 (2006).\n\u00a0 Petitioner's extended sentence, based on judge-determined facts, violated Apprendi v. New Jersey and represented \"a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\".\u00a0 350 F. Supp. 2d 848 (2004).\n\u00a0 Question whether trial court may rely solely on the pre-sentence diagnosis and report to make finding that defendant is a multiple offender raised but not decided.\u00a0 56 H. 32, 526 P.2d 1200 (1974).\n\u00a0 Extended sentence imposed on multiple offender held not cruel and unusual punishment.\u00a0 56 H. 343, 537 P.2d 724 (1975).\n\u00a0 Proof beyond reasonable doubt in separate proceeding is required.\u00a0 56 H. 628, 548 P.2d 632 (1976).\n\u00a0 Where prior conviction is an element of the crime, it should be proven in the case in chief in a one stage proceeding.\u00a0 57 H. 339, 555 P.2d 1199 (1976).\n\u00a0 Applicability of the due process guarantees to the two-step process of imposing a sentence for extended term.\u00a0 60 H. 71, 588 P.2d 394 (1978).\n\u00a0 Contents of record on appeal.\u00a0 60 H. 71, 588 P.2d 394 (1978).\n\u00a0 In paragraph (4), the criterion that the extended term is \"warranted\" is construed to mean \"necessary for the protection of the public.\"\u00a0 60 H. 71, 588 P.2d 394 (1978).\n\u00a0 Provisions not unconstitutional.\u00a0 60 H. 100, 588 P.2d 409 (1978).\n\u00a0 Trial court permissibly relied on pre-sentence report in finding defendant to be a persistent offender, where facts establishing defendant as such offender were in the record apart from the pre-sentence report.\u00a0 60 H. 100, 588 P.2d 409 (1978).\n\u00a0 Paragraph (4) interpreted as not requiring separate step to determine criminality.\u00a0 60 H. 308, 588 P.2d 394 (1978).\n\u00a0 Full-hearing requirement under section does not apply to adjustments of pre-penal code sentences under Act 188, SL 1975.\u00a0 61 H. 517, 606 P.2d 83 (1980).\n\u00a0 Criteria for imposition of extended term on multiple offender.\u00a0 62 H. 112, 612 P.2d 110 (1980).\n\u00a0 At the voir dire stage, it is uncertain whether the extended term provision for a multiple offender is applicable, and a defendant charged with three counts of robbery in the first degree is not entitled to twelve peremptory challenges pursuant to HRPP 24(b).\u00a0 63 H. 354, 628 P.2d 1018 (1981).\n\u00a0 Not cruel and unusual punishment under circumstances.\u00a0 63 H. 488, 630 P.2d 619 (1981).\n\u00a0 Sufficient evidence to impose extended term.\u00a0 63 H. 488, 630 P.2d 619 (1981); 63 H. 636, 633 P.2d 1115 (1981).\n\u00a0 Defendant should be permitted to show that counsel was ineffective at time of prior convictions.\u00a0 65 H. 354, 652 P.2d 1119 (1982).\n\u00a0 Circuit court did not err in first step of extended term sentencing procedure; case remanded to circuit court for specification of reasons for determining that extended terms were necessary for protection of public and entry of findings of fact to support that determination. 78 H. 383, 894 P.2d 80 (1995).\n\u00a0 No abuse of discretion in court sentencing defendant to extended terms of imprisonment under \u00a7706-661 and this section where, inter alia, court considered each of the factors enumerated in \u00a7706-606 and all the mitigating factors raised by defendant.\u00a0 83 H. 335, 926 P.2d 1258 (1996).\n\u00a0 A psychiatric or psychological evaluation of a defendant under paragraph (3) does not require a face-to-face interview in cases where defendant refuses to be examined.\u00a0 85 H. 258, 942 P.2d 522 (1997).\n\u00a0 Where witness testimonies provided proof beyond reasonable doubt that defendant had significant history of dangerousness resulting in criminally violent conduct, extended term sentence under paragraph (3) proper and necessary for protection of public.\u00a0 85 H. 258, 942 P.2d 522 (1997).\n\u00a0 Where psychologist was competent to testify, foundation for testimony properly laid, and testimony established a history of defendant's violence, trial court did not abuse discretion in finding that psychologist's testimony constituted proof beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant had a \"significant history of dangerousness to others resulting in criminally violent conduct\", pursuant to paragraph (3).\u00a0 90 H. 280, 978 P.2d 718 (1999).\n\u00a0 Findings under paragraph (5) regarding (a) the age or handicapped status of the victim and (b) whether \"such disability is known or reasonably should be known to the defendant\" entail \"intrinsic\" facts; Hawaii constitution requires these findings to be made by the trier of fact, not the sentencing court.\u00a0 91 H. 261, 982 P.2d 890 (1999).\n\u00a0 A sentencing court may not impose an enhanced sentence based on a defendant's refusal to admit guilt with respect to an offense the conviction of which the defendant intends to appeal.\u00a0 103 H. 315, 82 P.3d 401 (2003).\n\u00a0 Trial court violated defendant's constitutional privilege against self-incrimination by imposing an enhanced sentence pursuant to paragraph (4) based solely on defendant's refusal to admit defendant's guilt with respect to the offenses of which defendant was convicted by the jury.\u00a0 103 H. 315, 82 P.3d 401 (2003).\n\u00a0 Hawaii's extended term sentencing scheme is not incompatible with Blakely v. Washington, as (1) Blakely addresses only statutory \"determinate\"\u00a0 sentencing \"guideline\" schemes, and (2) the Hawaii supreme court's \"intrinsic-extrinsic\" analysis culminating in State v. Kaua is compatible with both Blakely and Apprendi v. New Jersey.\u00a0 106 H. 146, 102 P.3d 1044 (2004).\n\u00a0 Trial court did not err in sentencing defendant to extended terms of imprisonment under this section where it found that (1) defendant was a persistent and multiple offender and (2) that defendant's commitment for an extended term was necessary for the protection of the public.\u00a0 106 H. 146, 102 P.3d 1044 (2004).\n\u00a0 Trial court did not err in sentencing defendant to extended terms of imprisonment as a \"multiple offender\" pursuant to paragraph (4)(a); without this finding that the defendant committed a previous felony, notwithstanding that such an extended term may be considered \"necessary for protection of the public\", a judge would not be authorized to impose it; and extended term sentencing did not run afoul of Sixth Amendment to U.S. Constitution as interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court in Apprendi v. New Jersey.\u00a0 110 H. 79, 129 P.3d 1107 (2006).\n\u00a0 Inasmuch as this section authorizes the sentencing court to extend a defendant's sentence beyond the \"standard term\" authorized solely by the jury's verdict by requiring the sentencing court, rather than the trier of fact, to make an additional necessity finding that does not fall under Apprendi's prior-or-concurrent-convictions exception, this section is unconstitutional on its face; thus, defendant's extended term sentences imposed by the trial court violated defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial and were illegal.\u00a0 115 H. 432, 168 P.3d 562 (2007).\n\u00a0 Invocation of a court's inherent power to provide process where none exists, by reforming this section (1996) to allow for jury fact-finding did not violate defendant's due process right, where assigning the fact-finding role to the jury would be a procedural, as opposed to a substantive, change that would not expand the scope of criminal liability, increase punishment, or alter any evidentiary burdens to defendant's detriment, but, rather, would simply change the course to a result.\u00a0 117 H. 381, 184 P.3d 133 (2008).\n\u00a0 The constitutional prohibition against ex post facto measures was not offended by the plain language of Act 1, L Sp 2007 2d, amending \u00a7\u00a7706-661, 706-664, and this section regarding sentencing or resentencing for extended terms of imprisonment, where it was clear that the new jury provisions did not (1) increase criminal liability for conduct previously innocent, (2) aggravate the degree of defendant's crimes, (3) increase the punishment available at the time defendant committed defendant's crimes, or (4) alter evidentiary standards to defendant's detriment.\u00a0 117 H. 381, 184 P.3d 133 (2008).\n\u00a0 Where enactment of Act 1, L Sp 2007 2d provided conclusive expression of legislative support for the use of juries as the trier of fact with respect to extended term sentencing fact-finding, invocation of circuit court's inherent power to reform this section so as to preserve its constitutionality did not unduly burden or substantially interfere with the other branch's exercise of its power.\u00a0 117 H. 381, 184 P.3d 133 (2008).\n\u00a0 This section sets forth the facts the jury must find in order to authorize the court to increase the defendant's sentence beyond the statutory maximum for the offense of manslaughter; as the matter of parole was a matter outside the scope of the jury's function, which was limited to finding the two operative facts under this section, it was error for the trial court to instruct the jury on parole.\u00a0 127 H. 91, 276 P.3d 660 (2012).\n\u00a0 The constitutional prohibition against ex post facto measures was not offended by the retrospective application to defendant of Act 1, L Sp 2007 2d, amending \u00a7\u00a7706-661, 706-664, and this section, where Act 1 did not punish as a crime an act previously committed which was innocent when done, make more burdensome the punishment for the crime after its commission, nor deprive one charged with the crime of any defense available according to the law when the act was committed.\u00a0 118 H. 68 (App.), 185 P.3d 816 (2008).\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7\u00a7706-661 AND 706-662\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 These sections provide for extended terms of imprisonment for the exceptionally difficult defendant.\u00a0 The Code's limited recognition of consecutive sentences, and its attempt to provide lower authorized sentences for the majority of convicted defendants whose records or situations do not suggest the need for extended incarceration, necessitates some provision for dealing with the persistent, professional, dangerous, and multiple offender.\u00a0 Unlike other offenders, these defendants should be subject to possible extended terms because their records or situations indicate that extended incarceration may be necessary to protect the public.\u00a0 In these cases, rehabilitation, if possible, is unlikely to be achieved within an ordinary term.\n\u00a0 The Code takes a flexible approach with respect to extended imprisonment.\u00a0 If one or more of the grounds provided by \u00a7706-662 is established, it remains discretionary with the court whether an extended term will be imposed--its imposition is not mandatory.\n\u00a0 Section 706-662 authorizes an extended term in the case of (1) a persistent offender, (2) a professional criminal, (3) a dangerous person, and (4) a multiple offender.\u00a0 Subsections (1) through (4) state the minimal requirements for each of the findings.\u00a0 These requirements are not intended as mandates, or even guidelines, but rather as limitations on the court's exercise of discretion.\n[T]he existence of the minimal conditions do not make the finding necessary nor is it, indeed, compulsory in any case.\u00a0 Minimal conditions are stated as a safeguard against possible abusive findings, not as a judgment that establishment of the conditions necessarily demands that the finding in question should be made.\u00a0 Of course, before the court can make the ultimate finding required, it must find that the minimal conditions are established.[1]\n\u00a0\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON \u00a7\u00a7706-661 AND 706-662\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Act 210, Session Laws 1978, amended \u00a7706-662 by adding paragraph (5), finding offenses against the elderly and the handicapped to be a significant problem.\n\u00a0 Act 166, Session Laws 1981, amended \u00a7706-662 by deleting the requirement that defendants be at least twenty-two years of age before they become subject to possible extended terms as persistent offenders or professional criminals, it appearing that those most often arrested and sentenced for felonies fell in the eighteen to twenty-five year age group.\u00a0 As amended, the section authorizes the court to impose extended terms, in appropriate cases, regardless of the defendant's age.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 705.\n\u00a0 Act 280, Session Laws 1985, amended \u00a7706-662 to impose an extended prison term on a defendant who, while committing or attempting to commit certain felony offenses, inflicts serious bodily injury on a person who is blind, paraplegic, quadriplegic, sixty years old or older, or eight years of age or younger.\u00a0 This amendment addresses the needs of persons who cannot protect themselves as well as expresses condemnation of defendants who commit crimes against those persons.\u00a0 House Standing Committee Report No. 398, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 852.\n\u00a0 Act 305, Session Laws 1988, amended \u00a7706-662 by clarifying the definition of dangerousness by removing old language and using language which conforms more to \"state of the art\" knowledge about violence prediction.\u00a0 The legislature stated that this would lead to an increase in the accuracy of violence prediction by focusing on the two principal components, history of dangerousness and present triggers of violent behavior.\u00a0 This section was also amended to allow the introduction of victim-related data in order to establish dangerousness.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2153.\n\u00a0 Act 3, Session Laws 1996, amended \u00a7706-662 by adding manslaughter to the crimes for which an extended term of imprisonment may be given when the defendant inflicts serious or substantial bodily injury on a person sixty years or older, handicapped, or eight years or younger.\u00a0 The legislature found that the elderly, handicapped, and children are more vulnerable and should be provided more protection, and that adding manslaughter to the enhanced sentencing statute was consistent with the policy to protect the more vulnerable people in the community.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2036, House Standing Committee Report No. 988-96.\n\u00a0 Act 286, Session Laws 1999, amended \u00a7706-661 to make the extended term of imprisonment for murder in the second degree an indeterminate life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 89.\n\u00a0 Act 240, Session Laws 2001, amended \u00a7706-662 by allowing extended terms of imprisonment for perpetrators of hate-motivated crimes, to protect Hawaii's citizens from crimes motivated by bigotry and hate.\u00a0 House Standing Committee Report No. 1422.\n\u00a0 Act 33, Session Laws 2003, amended \u00a7706-662, among others, to protect a person's actual or perceived gender identity or expression under the State's current hate crime laws.\u00a0 The legislature found that one child out of two hundred is born with noticeable gender ambiguity, and one child out of one hundred has hidden ambiguity.\u00a0 These persons often struggle with their gender identity and are ridiculed, harassed, and sometimes assaulted by others for being different.\u00a0 The U.S. Department of Justice reports that hate crimes directed against gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender citizens are especially violent.\u00a0 \"Sexual orientation,\" currently included in the hate crimes law, is not the same as \"gender identity.\" \u00a0The legislature believed that this class of persons should be included and afforded protection under Hawaii's hate crime laws.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 593, House Standing Committee Report No. 1184.\n\u00a0 Act 230, Session Laws 2006, amended \u00a7706-661 to require the court to consider public safety in deciding whether to impose an extended term of imprisonment.\u00a0 Act 230 amended \u00a7706-662 to clarify that a defendant who has been convicted of a felony qualifies for an extended term of imprisonment under \u00a7706-661.\u00a0 Act 230 also provided that the amendments to \u00a7\u00a7706-661 and 706-662 would sunset on June 30, 2007.\u00a0 House Standing Committee Report No. 665-06, Conference Committee Report No. 94-06.\n\u00a0 Act 1, Second Special Session Laws 2007, amended Hawaii's extended sentencing statutes, \u00a7\u00a7706-661, 706-662, and 706-664, to ensure that the procedures used to impose extended terms of imprisonment comply with the requirements of the United States Supreme Court and the Hawaii supreme court.\u00a0 Act 1 required that a jury determine the facts necessary to impose an extended term of imprisonment, unless the defendant waives the right to a jury determination, and that facts necessary to impose an extended term of imprisonment are proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u00a0 The legislature found that Hawaii's current extended sentencing procedure had been deemed unconstitutional because a judge, rather than a jury, was required to find facts, other than those of prior or concurrent convictions, necessary to enhance a defendant's sentence beyond the ordinary or standard term authorized by the jury's verdict.\u00a0 Act 1's amendments conformed the State's enhanced sentencing law to the requirements of the United States Supreme Court and the Hawaii supreme court.\u00a0 Act 1 applied retroactively to sentencing or resentencing proceedings that were pending on or commenced after its effective date [October 31, 2007], whether the offense was committed prior to, on, or after that date.\u00a0 However, the Act did not entitle a defendant who was previously sentenced to an extended term of imprisonment to resentencing pursuant to the procedures set forth in the Act, unless the defendant was otherwise legally entitled to be resentenced.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 7, House Standing Committee Report No. 1.\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7\u00a7706-661 and 706-662 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 M.P.C., Tentative Draft No. 2, comments at
