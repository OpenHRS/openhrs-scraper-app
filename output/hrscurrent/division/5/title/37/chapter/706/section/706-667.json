[the defendant's] correction and rehabilitation and will not jeopardize the protection of the public.\"\u00a0 Assuming the court is satisfied that this condition can be met, there seems no reason for not allowing the court, if it chooses, to protect the young offender from the longer maxima provided for felonies.\n\u00a0\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON \u00a7706-667\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 The legislature in enacting the Code in 1972 changed subsection (2) by making it discretionary with the court, rather than mandatory, to commit the young adult defendant to the custody of the department of social services and housing for specialized treatment.\n\u00a0 Act 295, Session Laws 1980, amended this section to establish a more equitable and just system of sentencing young adults.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 34-80 (42-80).\u00a0 Subsection (1) was amended by changing the definition of a young adult defendant so as to exclude repeat felony offenders from the class of young persons entitled to specialized treatment.\u00a0 Subsection (3) was amended to provide for different terms of imprisonment depending upon whether the offense involved is a class A, B, or C felony.\u00a0 Subsection (3) was also amended by the addition of an express provision that young adults be incarcerated separately from career criminals when practicable.\u00a0 Lastly, the section was amended to provide that it does not apply to the offense of murder.\n\u00a0 Act 318, Session Laws 1997, amended this section by defining a young adult defendant as a person convicted of a crime who, at the time of sentencing, is less than twenty-two years of age.\u00a0 The legislature found that immediate action was necessary for the protection and safety of the community from the growing number of minors who commit violent, serious, or multiple felonies.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1561.\n\u00a0 Act 230, Session Laws 2006, amended this section to, among other things, require that the young adult defendant be less than twenty-two years at the time of the offense, rather than at the time of sentencing.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Not repealed by implication by \u00a7706-606.1.\u00a0 67 H. 46, 677 P.2d 463 (1984).\n\u00a0 Defendant did not fall within definition of a young adult defendant.\u00a0 71 H. 609, 801 P.2d 553 (1990).\n\u00a0 Reasonable inference could be drawn that sentencing court considered special eight-year term prior to sentencing young adult defendant to twenty-year term under \u00a7706-659.\u00a0 73 H. 259, 831 P.2d 523 (1992).\n\u00a0 A sentencing court must afford a defendant his or her right of presentence allocution before ruling on the applicability of the young adult defendants statute.\u00a0 90 H. 280, 978 P.2d 718 (1999).\n\u00a0 Defendant, who was age-eligible for sentencing under this section, the young adult defendant statute, at the time defendant's deferred acceptance of guilty plea was granted, but age-ineligible at the time it was revoked, could not thereafter be sentenced as a young adult defendant; specialized treatment under this section is afforded only to those who are less than the prescribed twenty-two years of age at the time of sentencing.\u00a0 93 H. 362, 3 P.3d 1239 (2000).\n\u00a0 Sentencing court did retain the discretion to sentence petitioner defendant, who was convicted of violating \u00a7712-1240.8, to a special five-year indeterminate term of imprisonment under this section.\u00a0 Specifically, the phrase \"[n]otwithstanding sections 706-620, 706-640, 706-641, 706-660, 706-669, and any other law to the contrary\", found in the sentencing provision of \u00a7712-1240.8(3), did not override sentencing petitioner defendant under this section as \"contrary\".\u00a0 130 H. 21, 305 P.3d 437 (2013).\n\u00a0 Referred to:\u00a0 56 H. 75, 527 P.2d 1269 (1974); 61 H. 1, 594 P.2d 1078 (1979).\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7706-667 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 M.P.C., Tentative Draft No. 7, comments at 24 (1957)."
