[L 2006, c 58, \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7706-622.8\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Act 58, Session Laws 2006, added this section to allow a person sentenced prior to July 1, 2004, for a first-time drug offense pursuant to \u00a7706-622.5, who completed a drug treatment program and complied with the terms set by the court, to apply for expungement of the record of conviction.\u00a0 Act 58 corrected a drafting error in Act 161, Session Laws 2002, which authorized an expungement of the record of arrest rather than the record of conviction.\u00a0 Act 44, Session Laws 2004, corrected the error, authorizing the expungement of the record of conviction, but only prospectively from its effective date, July 1, 2004.\u00a0 This led to the inconsistent result of some defendants being permitted to expunge their record of conviction and others not being able to do so.\u00a0 Act 58 permitted defendants sentenced prior to Act 44, Session Laws 2004, to expunge their record of conviction.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3212."
