[L 1988, c 89, \u00a71; am L 1990, c 67, \u00a78; am L 2015, c 35, \u00a722]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7706-660.2\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Act 89, Session Laws 1988, added this section to mandate harsher penalties for crimes against victims who are less able to protect themselves.\u00a0 The legislature found that passage of this section will afford a greater measure of protection for the groups designated in this section.\u00a0 House Standing Committee Report No. 459-88, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2544.\n\u00a0 Act 35, Session Laws 2015, amended this section by adding subsection designations and making other technical nonsubstantive amendments.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 No error in sentence of life imprisonment with a mandatory minimum term of fifteen years for attempted second degree murder of infant by abandonment where defendant left infant in danger of death by reason of exposure or accident.\u00a0 73 H. 109, 831 P.2d 512 (1992).\n\u00a0 Determination that a defendant is within the class of offenders to which this section applies to be made by sentencing court after defendant's adjudication of guilt at trial by the trier of fact.\u00a0 82 H. 304, 922 P.2d 358 (1996).\n\u00a0 As an attempt to commit a crime is an offense of the same class and grade as the offense which is attempted, and second degree murder committed under the \"aggravated circumstances\" set forth in this section is expressly distinguished from classified felonies and, pursuant to \u00a7706-610, from unclassified felonies; thus, attempted second degree murder is not an \"unclassified\" offense for purposes of sentencing and is not treated as a class C felony pursuant to this section.\u00a0 96 H. 17, 25 P.3d 792 (2001).\n\u00a0 Failure to instruct the jury to determine whether infant victim was under the age of eight and whether defendant knew it, or should have known it, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt; omitted sentencing factor was supported by uncontroverted evidence, including defendant's admission, that defendant's infant daughter was under the age of eight.\u00a0 96 H. 17, 25 P.3d 792 (2001).\n\u00a0 As defendant could only be sentenced under the options available for the offense for which defendant was convicted, defendant had only pled guilty to and was convicted of the offense of assault in the first degree, and plea was devoid of reference to all necessary aggravating circumstances, trial court erred in resentencing defendant to an indeterminate ten-year sentence with a mandatory minimum term of three years and four months under this section. 93 H. 189 (App.), 998 P.2d 70 (2000).\n\u00a0 Where aggravating circumstance of complainant's age was not set forth in the plea agreement or admitted or stipulated to as part of the guilty plea, there was an insufficient factual basis in the accepted guilty plea to support the mandatory prison term under this section.\u00a0 93 H. 189 (App.), 998 P.2d 70 (2000)."
