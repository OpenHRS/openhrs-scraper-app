[L 2002, c 161, \u00a73; am L 2004, c 44, \u00a711; am L 2006, c 230, \u00a718; am L Sp 2009, c 4, \u00a73; am L 2012, c 140, \u00a72; am L 2016, c 231, \u00a721]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7706-622.5\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Act 161, Session Laws 2002, added this section to require, among other things, that first-time nonviolent drug offenders be sentenced to undergo and complete drug treatment instead of incarceration.\u00a0 The legislature found that the link between substance abuse and crime is well-established.\u00a0 The legislature did not wish to diminish the seriousness of crime, but looked to approaching crime as being the result of addiction that is treatable.\u00a0 The treatment route was expected to produce a reduction in crime and recidivism.\u00a0 The legislature intended to promote treatment of nonviolent substance abuse offenders, rather than incarceration, as being in the best interests of the individual and the community at large.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 96-02.\n\u00a0 Act 230, Session Laws 2006, amended subsection (1) to exclude the offenses of methamphetamine trafficking in the first and second degrees from the offenses for which first-time drug offenders may be eligible to be sentenced to probation.\n\u00a0 Act 4, Special Session Laws 2009, amended subsection (2) authorizing the placement of certain drug offenders in secure drug treatment facilities, to promote the rehabilitation of convicted drug offenders through alternatives to incarceration.\u00a0 The legislature found that providing convicted drug offenders with drug rehabilitation programs in a secure drug treatment facility would reduce the offenders' rate of recidivism upon release and help the offenders develop an important and meaningful role in society.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1285, Conference Committee Report No. 25.\n\u00a0 Act 140, Session Laws 2012, amended this section by:\u00a0 (1) allowing for the sentence of probation for certain second time drug offenses; and (2) clarifying that a person sentenced to probation as a first time drug offender who has not been previously sentenced to probation as a drug offender shall be eligible for expungement only once.\u00a0 The legislature found that the rates of crime, victimization, and arrests and felony convictions for violent and property crimes had declined, while the number of persons incarcerated or under probation supervision, in some cases, had increased.\u00a0 The legislature also found that existing law required the courts to impose a prison sentence for an offender who had a second felony conviction for drug possession.\u00a0 Act 140 amended the law to allow for second time drug offenders to be eligible for probation.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3352, Conference Committee Report No. 130-12.\n\u00a0\u00a0Act 231, Session Laws 2016, amended subsections (1) and (4) to implement recommendations made by the Penal Code Review Committee convened pursuant to House Concurrent Resolution No. 155, S.D. 1 (2015).\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Inasmuch as the plain and unambiguous language of \u00a7706-606.5 requires application of the repeat offender statute over \"any other law to the contrary\", the circuit court did not err in sentencing defendant as a repeat offender pursuant to \u00a7706-606.5; in all cases in which \u00a7706-606.5 is applicable, including those in which a defendant would otherwise be eligible for probation under this section, the circuit courts must sentence defendants pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7706-606.5.\u00a0 103 H. 228, 81 P.3d 408 (2003).\n\u00a0 Defendants with prior felony convictions of drug offenses are disqualified from sentencing pursuant to this section, even if the convictions occurred in other jurisdictions and therefore not \"under part IV of chapter 712\", so long as the offenses would implicate part IV of chapter 712 if committed in Hawaii.\u00a0 104 H. 71, 85 P.3d 178 (2004).\n\u00a0 By its plain language, Act 44, L 2004, prospectively permitted greater discretion to sentencing courts confronted with conflicts between this section and \u00a7706-606.5 than they previously possessed; thus, based on the legislative intent reflected in Act 44, the Act 161, L 2002 version of this section, under which defendant was sentenced, did not trump the repeat offender statute.\u00a0 106 H. 1, 100 P.3d 595 (2004).\n\u00a0 As section is ameliorative in its intent and effect and its application would neither be detrimental nor materially disadvantageous to the defendant, retrospective application of this section as established by Act 161, L 2002, was not prohibited; where defendant did not qualify as a first-time drug offender, the trial court did not err in sentencing defendant pursuant to \u00a7712-1243(3) (2002).\u00a0 107 H. 215, 112 P.3d 69 (2005).\n\u00a0 Consistent with \u00a7706-625(1), because petitioner, who was sentenced to probation under subsection (1), had completed petitioner's probation term and was subsequently discharged and thus \"satisfied the disposition of the court\", as provided by \u00a7706-630, petitioner had, in effect, complied with the terms and conditions of probation for purposes of expungement under subsection (4).\u00a0 129 H. 363, 300 P.3d 1022 (2013)."
