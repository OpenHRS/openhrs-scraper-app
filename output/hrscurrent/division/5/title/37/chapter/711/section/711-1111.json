part IV.\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7711-1111\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 This section is provided on the theory that in an era of increasing use of electronic eavesdropping devices, criminal sanctions should be used to protect an individual's right of privacy.\u00a0 Wiretapping is contrary to federal law, but it is right that state law should also be on record against it.\u00a0 Therefore, in addition to simple trespassory, nonmechanical eavesdropping, covered in subsection (1)(a), \u00a7711-1111 forbids any sort of electronic or mechanical eavesdropping or surveillance whether done through some physical connection with the place under surveillance or not.\u00a0 Thus subsection (1)(b) forbids installation or use of eavesdropping equipment in a \"private place\" (defined in \u00a7711-1100) whereas subsection (1)(c) forbids the use anywhere of equipment designed to receive sounds originating in a private place and normally inaudible or incomprehensible outside.\u00a0 Physical contact with the private place is not necessary.\u00a0 Subsection (1)(d) generally forbids wiretapping, but does not apply to listening in on a party line or extension phone (these are risks known to all telephone users and are not of the magnitude of a wiretap), nor does it apply to interception by the telephone company or a subscriber seeking to ascertain that the telephone is not being put to improper use.\u00a0 Thus a company with a telephone switchboard would not be guilty of a crime if it ordered an employee to monitor calls in order to assure that instructions limiting use of the telephone to business calls were being followed.\u00a0 Subsection (1)(e) forbids anyone to divulge the existence or contents of a telephone call, telegram, or letter, which he knows was unlawfully intercepted, or which he learned of in the course of his employment by a transmitting agency, without the consent of the sender or the receiver.\u00a0 Since subsection (1)(d) has the exceptions noted, subsection (1)(e) would not cover the party line eavesdropper who reveals what he has overheard.\n\u00a0 Previous Hawaii law in this area was limited to violations of privacy resulting from interception or recordation of telephone and wire communications.[1]\u00a0 The Code, therefore, is broader in its overall scope than prior law.\u00a0 However, as applied to telephone and wire interceptions or recordations, the Code would limit criminal liability to situations where the conduct was engaged in without the consent of both parties (sender and receiver) to the conversation or communication.\u00a0 If one of the parties to the communication authorizes its interception or recordation (e.g., in an attempt to trace obscene or extortionary telephone calls), criminal sanctions ought not to result.\n\u00a0\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON \u00a7711-1111\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Act 278, Session Laws 1999, amended this section, more specifically, by making the offense of violation of privacy in the second degree a misdemeanor.\u00a0 The offense does not include the installation of any device for, among other things, videotaping or filming another person in a state of undress or sexual activity, which is covered under \u00a7711-1110.9.\u00a0 The knowing possession of materials created under circumstances prohibited in \u00a7711-1110.9 is included as an offense under this section.\n\u00a0 Act 48, Session Laws 2003, amended this section to update the crime of violation of privacy in the second degree to punish \"video voyeurism\" in public places.\u00a0 The legislature found that through technological advancements, recording and broadcasting devices are easily concealed.\u00a0 Incidents of \"video voyeurism\" in public places have occurred but are not chargeable under existing laws.\u00a0\u00a0 Changing the offense of violation of privacy would address the growing concern for the offensive practice of \"upskirt photography.\"\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 637, House Standing Committee Report No. 1316.\n\u00a0 Act 83, Session Laws 2004, amended this section to include photographic images among the types of private communications that may not be intercepted or divulged without the consent of the sender or receiver, except when the images are disseminated, distributed, or transferred by electronic communication service providers or remote storage services in the ordinary course of business.\u00a0 Act 83 also defined the terms \"electronic communication,\" \"electronic communication service,\" \"electronic communication service provider,\" \"electronic communication system,\" and \"remote storage service.\"\u00a0 Act 83 made statutory amendments to the existing privacy law in order to prohibit the inappropriate use of new digital technologies, such as cellular phones, that are capable of taking digital photographs and transmitting those images.\u00a0 House Standing Committee Report No. 826-04, Conference Committee Report No. 43-04.\n\u00a0 Act 230, Session Laws 2006, amended subsection (1) to add peering or peeping into windows and trespassing on property for sexual gratification to the offense of violation of privacy in the second degree.\u00a0 House Standing Committee Report No. 665-06.\n\u00a0 Act 59, Session Laws 2012, amended this section to exclude the surveillance of another in a stage of undress or sexual activity as such acts are covered by violation of privacy in the first degree.\u00a0 The legislature found that existing law regarding a violation of privacy in the second degree, a misdemeanor, as it pertains to a person in a stage of undress or sexual activity was also covered by the felony offense of violation of privacy in the first degree.\u00a0 According to testimony submitted, case law required that a violator be charged under the lesser charge in order to avoid constitutional due process and equal protection issues.\u00a0 Act 59 would resolve that conflict by excluding the behavior from the lesser second degree offense, thereby allowing violators to be charged under the felony offense.\u00a0 House Standing Committee Report No. 664-12, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3199.\n\u00a0 Act 164, Session Laws 2016, amended this section to establish an exception to the offense of violation of privacy in the second degree for a person making a video or audio recording or photograph of a law enforcement officer while the officer is in the performance of duties in a public place or under circumstances in which the officer has no reasonable expectation of privacy; provided that the officer may take reasonable action to maintain safety and control, secure crime scenes and accident sites, protect the integrity and confidentiality of investigations, and protect the public safety and order.\u00a0 The legislature found that with the popularity and widespread use of smart phones with video or audio recording and photographing capabilities, recordings and photos of law enforcement officers who are exercising their duties have been used as evidence in police conduct matters or widely disseminated via social media.\u00a0 However, such recordings and photographs may be seen as obstructing government operations or an invasion of privacy.\u00a0 Act 164 established an exception under certain circumstances to enable a person to record or photograph a law enforcement officer exercising the officer's duties without violating the law.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2525, Conference Committee Report No. 129-16.\n\u00a0\nLaw
