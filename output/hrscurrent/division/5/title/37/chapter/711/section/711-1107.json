[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; gen ch 1993; am L 2002, c 198, \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nRevision Note\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 In subsection (1)(a), \"or\" deleted pursuant to \u00a723G-15.\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7711-1107\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Previous Hawaii law prohibited certain types of desecration.\u00a0 For example, desecration of the United States flag was prohibited.[1]\u00a0 Section 711-1107 deals more generally with all acts of desecration; i.e., acts of physical damage to or mistreatment of venerated places and objects under circumstances which the defendant knows are likely to outrage the sensibilities of persons who observe or discover the defendant's actions.\u00a0 Thus, any desecration of a public monument or structure; or a place of worship or burial (public or private); or, in a public place, the national flag, or any other object (such as certain religious objects) revered by a substantial segment of the public, will constitute an offense.\u00a0 Damage by desecration is treated separately from other types of property damage because the sense of outrage produced by such acts is out of proportion to the monetary value of the damage.\u00a0 Thus, desecration is a misdemeanor, although many such cases might otherwise be petty misdemeanors under \u00a7708-823 because the object desecrated is worth less than $50.\n\u00a0\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON \u00a7711-1107\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Act 198, Session Laws 2002, amended this section by changing the penalty for desecration from a misdemeanor to one year imprisonment, a fine of $10,000, or both.\u00a0 The legislature found that recent vandalism at cemeteries denoted that the current financial penalties of a misdemeanor offense for desecration were an insufficient deterrent.\u00a0 The $10,000 fine was consistent with the penalty in \u00a76E-11(c), relating to destruction of historic property.\u00a0 The legislature believed that a burial place or grave deserved no less a penalty for damage than did a historical monument.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2957, House Standing Committee Report No. 416-02.\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7711-1107 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 H.R.S. \u00a7733-6; another example is \u00a7734-3 which prohibits desecration of a grave."
