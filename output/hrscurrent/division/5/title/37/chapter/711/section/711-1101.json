\"disorderly conduct\" has been very broadly defined in the past (see below) to include numerous petty annoyances to the public.\u00a0 Section 711-1101 gives a far narrower definition to the offense, both because some of the matters previously treated under that heading are now treated elsewhere and because some of the previous provisions seem unwise.\u00a0 The section requires proof of an intent to cause physical inconvenience or alarm, or at least a reckless creation of a risk thereof.\u00a0 Subsection (1)(a) is a standard clause in disorderly conduct legislation, aimed at actual fights and at other behavior tending to threaten the public generally, for this section requires public alarm, etc., as distinguished from the private alarm which may accompany assault.\u00a0 This is an important point.\u00a0 A person may not be arrested for disorderly conduct as a result of activity which annoys only the police, for example.[1]\u00a0 Police officers are trained and employed to bear the burden of hazardous situations, and it is not infrequent that private citizens have arguments with them.\u00a0 Short of conduct which causes \"physical inconvenience or alarm to a member or members of the public\" arguments with the police are merely hazards of the trade, which do not warrant criminal penalties.\n\u00a0 Subsection (1)(c) is directed at \"free\" speech which exceeds the bounds of constitutional protection.\u00a0 It is important not to limit free expression, so the formula adopted--\"offensively coarse\"--is meant to apply only to obscene and scatalogical language, and not to language that is politically or religiously offensive.\u00a0 The defendant must know, or must consciously disregard the risk, that the defendant's coarse language will be offensive.\u00a0 The subsection also prohibits abusive language likely to evoke a violent reaction from the hearer (though no such reaction need be proved) in order that the public peace will be promoted by its prohibition.\n\u00a0 Subsection (1)(d) is defined to include creation of a hazardous or physically offensive condition by an act not covered by any authorized license or permit.\u00a0 It would prohibit, for example, the use of a \"stink bomb,\" strewing garbage or other noxious substances in public places, and turning off the lights in a public auditorium.\u00a0 Although there is some degree of overlap in some situations between this provision and \u00a7708-828 (criminal use of noxious substances) and \u00a7708-829 (criminal littering), subsection (1)(d) is needed to cover those cases of public annoyance where a private property owner does not wish to file a complaint or where title to property is not clear.\n\u00a0 Disorderly conduct is a violation unless it is the defendant's intention to cause substantial harm or serious inconvenience, or if the defendant persists in disorderly conduct after a reasonable warning or request to desist.\n\u00a0 The previous Hawaii statute covered a wide range of activity.\u00a0 The text of the former statute follows:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Any person who with intent to provoke a breach of the peace, or whereby a breach of the peace may be occasioned, commits any of the following acts shall be deemed to have committed the offense of disorderly conduct:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 Uses offensive, disorderly, threatening, abusive or insulting language, conduct or behavior;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 Congregates with others on a public street or sidewalk and refuses to move on when ordered by the police;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (3)\u00a0 By his actions causes a crowd to collect, except when lawfully addressing such a crowd;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (4)\u00a0 Shouts or makes a noise either outside or inside a building during the nighttime to the annoyance or disturbance of any three or more persons;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (5)\u00a0 Interferes with any person in any place by jostling against such person or unnecessarily crowding him or by placing a hand in proximity of such person's pocket, pocketbook or handbag;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (6)\u00a0 Stations himself on the public streets or sidewalks or follows pedestrians for the purpose of soliciting alms, or who solicits alms on the public streets unlawfully;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (7)\u00a0 Frequents or loiters about any public place soliciting men for the purpose of committing a crime against nature or other lewdness;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (8)\u00a0 Causes a disturbance in any street car, railroad car, omnibus or other public conveyance, by running through it, climbing through windows or upon the seats, or otherwise annoying passengers or employees therein;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (9)\u00a0 Stands on sidewalks or street corners and makes insulting remarks to or about passing pedestrians or annoys such pedestrians;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (10)\u00a0 Makes or causes to be made repeated telephone calls with intent to annoy and disturb another person or his family;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (11)\u00a0 Wears clothing of the opposite sex in any public place with intent to deceive other persons by failing to identify his or her sex.[2]\nThe above offense of disorderly conduct was punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000 or imprisonment of not more than 1 year, or both.[3]\n\u00a0 It should be noted that all of the conduct covered by the previous law, except that included in paragraphs (6), (7), and (11), is covered by various sections of this chapter, if not by the offense of disorderly conduct itself.\n\u00a0\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON \u00a7711-1101\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 When the legislature adopted the Code in 1972, it changed the wording of the Proposed Draft's subsection (1)(c), which is now subsection (1)(d).\u00a0 The Proposed Draft had recommended that the offense apply where the perpetrator commits an act \"which serves no legitimate purpose of the actor.\"\u00a0 The legislature changed that phrase to any act \"which is not performed under any authorized license or permit\", since it felt the language of the Proposed Draft was unconstitutionally vague.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 2 (1972).\n\u00a0 Act 136, Session Laws 1973, made two amendments.\u00a0 The offense of disorderly conduct was amended to require an intent to cause physical inconvenience or alarm by members of the public.\u00a0 Previously, the offense merely required an intent to cause \"public inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm.\"\u00a0 In addition, subsection (1)(b) (now subsection (1)(c)) was changed by adding the language \"which is likely to provoke a violent response\" after the word \"present.\"\n\u00a0 Act 164, Session Laws 1974, further amended the section by clarifying the offense when it involved the making of unreasonable noise.\u00a0 Conduct involving a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a law abiding citizen would follow would be a violation of this provision.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 967-74, states:\n\u00a0 The addition of a new subsection (2) defines the quality of unreasonable noise, as a general principle of penal liability, used throughout the Hawaii Penal Code, which can be found in \u00a7702-206.\u00a0 This definition sets forth an intelligent, flexible and reasonable standard by which enforcement of this provision can be made.\u00a0 The enforcement of this section is not intended to interfere with reasonable necessary commercial activities justifiable in their profession or trade and technologically tenable.\u00a0 For example, it is not an offense that commercial activity causes inconvenience upon a person or persons if, considering the nature and purpose of such activity and the circumstances surrounding the activity including the location, the nature of the day (whether a weekend or a holiday) and the time of the day or night, such activity is reasonable and prudent.\n\u00a0 Your Committee has categorically ruled out the argument that people who sleep during the day should not bear a greater burden than those people who sleep at night.\u00a0 We are well aware that because of Hawaii's diverse educational, commercial and recreational activities, some people have to sleep during the day through a degree of noise activity.\u00a0 But we believe that to limit the noise level of the day to that of the night would impose a dangerous evil that will cause irreparable damage to the general health and welfare of this state.\u00a0 However, the Committee finds that it is necessary to establish a reasonable standard that can be applied to all noise situations and not just the quiet of the night.\n\u00a0 Enforcement of proposed decible standards is impractical at this time.\u00a0 The state of the art and present technology do not lend themselves to an acceptable justification for their use in everyday enforcement.\n\u00a0 Act 182, Session Laws 1978, added subsection (1)(e).\u00a0 Conference Committee Report (Senate No. 31-78, House No. 27) states:\u00a0 \"The conduct which your Committee believes should be regulated is the impeding and obstructing while begging in a public place or place open to the public.\u00a0 Your Committee does not find that the specific conduct of begging alone is offensive but begging done in the specified manner which is offensive to the public should be regulated.\"\n\u00a0 Act 79, Session Laws 1979, added subsection (2) in order to clarify the offense of unreasonable noise.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 63 states:\n\u00a0 Your Committee finds that under current statutes, in order to convict a person under the disorderly conduct statute for making unreasonable noise, one must prove that such person's actions involved a gross deviation from the standard of conduct of a law-abiding citizen.\u00a0 Prosecution has been difficult using this broad, if not vague, definition.\u00a0 This bill authorizes any police officer to make a determination of what is unreasonable noise and makes the failure of a person to heed his warning a punishable offense.\n\u00a0 Act 79 also holds a renter, resident or owner-occupant of a premises guilty of a noise violation if he knowingly or negligently consents to unreasonable noise on his premises.\n\u00a0 Act 48, Session Laws 2003, amended this section by updating the crime of disorderly conduct to punish \"video voyeurism\" in public places.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 637.\n\u00a0\nCase

App. 10, 612 P.2d 123 (1980).\n\u00a0 State failed to show that defendant possessed requisite state of mind for conviction under this section.\u00a0 1 H. App. 10, 612 P.2d 123 (1980).\n\u00a0 Evidence supported finding of disorderly conduct.\u00a0 5 H. App. 120, 678 P.2d 1107 (1984).\n\u00a0 State failed to prove that defendant intended to cause physical inconvenience or alarm or recklessly created a risk thereof to a member or members of public, where disorderly arrest was based on defendant's actions within apartment after police arrived.\u00a0 77 H. 314 (App.), 884 P.2d 377 (1994).\n\u00a0 Subsection (2) interpreted as implicitly requiring that a police officer's decision that noise is unreasonable must be supported by police officer's objectively reasonable finding that the noise is gross deviation from law-abiding citizen's standard of conduct; there was insufficient evidence of defendant's unreasonable noise to support the conviction of disorderly conduct/unreasonable noise either as a petty misdemeanor or as the lesser-included violation.\u00a0 78 H. 282 (App.), 892 P.2d 475 (1995).\n\u00a0 Insufficient evidence to establish that defendant's intent was to cause physical inconvenience or alarm by members of the public where all of defendant's statements and profanity were directed only at police officers and theatre manager.\u00a0 79 H. 538 (App.), 904 P.2d 552 (1995).\n\u00a0 Insufficient evidence to convict defendant under this section where evidence indicated there was perhaps one other patron in the library on the day defendant raised defendant's voice, no physical disruption of library services was caused, and there was no finding that defendant acted with the intent to cause physical inconvenience to, or alarm by, a member or members of the public, or that defendant acted with reckless disregard that defendant's conduct might produce such a result.\u00a0 107 H. 159 (App.), 111 P.3d 54 (2005).\n\u00a0 Mentioned:\u00a0 9 H.
