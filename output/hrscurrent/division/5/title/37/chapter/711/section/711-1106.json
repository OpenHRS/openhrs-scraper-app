Supp. 1167 (1994).\n\u00a0 Plaintiff firearm permit applicant's allegations that plaintiff was denied a permit and ordered to surrender plaintiff's weapons because of a conviction of harassment more than ten years before under this section and that the conviction was not a crime of violence under \u00a7134-7(b) or federal law for the purposes of prohibiting ownership or possession of firearms were sufficient to state a 42 U.S.C. \u00a71983 claim for a violation of plaintiff's Second Amendment rights.\u00a0 869 F. Supp. 2d 1203 (2012).\n\u00a0 Subsection (1)(a) was not categorically a crime of violence; court declined to interpret subsection (1)(a) in a manner that shifted the focus to whether the conduct caused a \"threat of injury\" as opposed to deterring conduct that offended a person's \"psyche and mental well-being\" even if there was no \"threat of injury\".\u00a0 976 F. Supp. 2d 1200 (2013).\n\u00a0 Where defendants argued that plaintiff was prohibited from possessing firearms under federal law because of the federal Lautenberg Amendment, which prohibits firearm ownership by any person who \"has been convicted in any court of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\", plaintiff's convictions for harassment did not qualify as a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence under federal law.\u00a0 976 F. Supp. 2d 1200 (2013).\n\u00a0 Elements of harassment construed.\u00a0 60 H. 540, 592 P.2d 810 (1979).\n\u00a0 Threatening and offensive remarks directed against police afforded police probable cause to arrest for harassment.\u00a0 61 H. 291, 602 P.2d 933 (1979).\n\u00a0 Harassment is not a lesser included offense of assault in the third degree in violation of \u00a7707-712.\u00a0 63 H. 1, 620 P.2d 250 (1980).\n\u00a0 Harassment not a lesser included offense of disorderly conduct.\u00a0 63 H. 548, 632 P.2d 654 (1981).\n\u00a0 Person charged with petty misdemeanor carrying maximum penalty of thirty days confinement, a fine, or both, is not entitled to jury trial.\u00a0 64 H. 374, 641 P.2d 978 (1982).\n\u00a0 Where minor's challenge to officer was not uttered in a manner likely to provoke a violent response on officer's part, there was insufficient evidence to support district family court's conclusion that minor committed offense of harassment in violation of subsection (1)(b).\u00a0 76 H. 85, 869 P.2d 1304 (1994).\n\u00a0 Because the broad language of \u00a7708-810 does not evidence an intent to confine crimes \"against a person\" to those enumerated in chapter 707, and harassment is a crime against a person, a conviction for burglary under \u00a7708-810 may be predicated on the offense of harassment.\u00a0 89 H. 284, 972 P.2d 287 (1998).\n\u00a0 An \"illegitimate purpose\" is not an element of the offense of harassment, as defined by subsection (1)(a); where substantial evidence that, after becoming angry and \"yelling\" at son, defendant slapped son in the face, trial court could reasonably have inferred that defendant intended defendant's conduct to \"annoy\" or \"alarm\" son.\u00a0 90 H. 85, 976 P.2d 399 (1999).\n\u00a0\u00a0Appellate court correctly held that there was sufficient evidence to sustain defendant's harassment conviction under subsection (1)(a) where defendant chose to slap minor in the face and strike minor with a bamboo stick at least five times with enough force to leave red welts visible the next day; based on the totality of circumstances in the case, substantial evidence existed to support the conclusion that the State proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the force defendant employed against minor was without due regard for minor's age and size, thus disproving defendant's parental justification defense under \u00a7703-309.\u00a0 126 H. 494, 273 P.3d 1180 (2012).\n\u00a0 Where appellate record referred to multiple cases in which a stay had been denied to petty misdemeanants pending appeal, indicating that the denial of a request for a stay of sentence appeared to be an issue that could potentially affect many petty misdemeanor defendants, was likely to recur in the future, and because there was no definitive case law on when the issuance of a stay after a petty misdemeanor conviction was appropriate, appellate court erred in not addressing the family court's failure to stay defendant's sentence pending appeal based on the mootness doctrine because the public interest exception applied.\u00a0 126 H. 494, 273 P.3d 1180 (2012).\n\u00a0 Where defendant charged with harassment in violation of subsection (1)(a) claimed that the disjunctively worded complaint left defendant unsure of how to prepare a defense:\u00a0 (1) because defendant was charged with violating only one subsection of the statute, codifying a single category of harassing behavior, the complaint did not violate the Jendrusch rule; and (2) when charging a defendant under a single subsection of a statute, the charge may be worded disjunctively in the language of the statute as long as the acts charged are reasonably related so that the charge provides sufficient notice to the defendant.\u00a0 131 H. 220, 317 P.3d 664 (2013).\n\u00a0 Conviction reversed where defendant merely drove his automobile along narrow street in opposite direction from automobile of former girlfriend and did not insult, taunt, or challenge.\u00a0 7 H. App. 582, 788 P.2d 173 (1990).\n\u00a0 Record did not support a finding that defendant either insulted, taunted, or challenged dog owner, or that defendant did so in a manner likely to provoke a violent response.\u00a0 77 H. 196 (App.), 881 P.2d 1264 (1994).\n\u00a0 Where defendant came up behind victim unexpectedly and threatened victim, screamed a 10-minute tirade at victim, and were actions taken without significant provocation or cognizable justification, facts sufficient to enable a reasonable person to conclude defendant violated subsection (1)(b).\u00a0 93 H. 513 (App.), 6 P.3d 385 (2000).\n\u00a0 Defendant's conviction under this section vacated where trial court's ruling that defendant engaged in \"reckless\" conduct did not satisfy the specific intent requirement of this section.\u00a0 95 H. 290 (App.), 22 P.3d 86 (2001).\n\u00a0 Under the plain meaning of subsection (1)(a), \"offensive physical contact\" encompassed the conduct of defendant knocking off police officer's hat--offensive contact that, while separate and apart from the various forms of actual bodily touching, nevertheless involved contact with an item physically appurtenant to the body.\u00a0 95 H. 290 (App.), 22 P.3d 86 (2001).\n\u00a0 Sufficient evidence supported trial court's finding that defendant committed offense of harassment.\u00a0 98 H. 459 (App.), 50 P.3d 428 (2002).\n\u00a0 Defendant's conviction of harassment under this section reversed where trial court erroneously concluded that father's actions could not be seen as reasonably necessary to protect the welfare of the recipient, and the State failed its burden of disproving beyond a reasonable doubt the justification evidence that was adduced, or proving beyond a reasonable doubt facts negativing the justification defense under \u00a7703-309.\u00a0 106 H. 252 (App.), 103 P.3d 412 (2004).\n\u00a0 Because there was no provision in \u00a7706-605 for the imposition of anger management or other treatment programs, but \u00a7706-624(2)(j) authorized the imposition of, inter alia, mental health treatment as a discretionary term of probation, district court erred by sentencing defendant to both the thirty-day term of imprisonment (the maximum term of imprisonment for a petty misdemeanor) and anger management classes for defendant's harassment conviction (a petty misdemeanor).\u00a0 Defendant could have been sentenced to a thirty-day term of incarceration or a six-month term of probation, but not both, and thus defendant's sentence was illegal.\u00a0 130 H. 332 (App.), 310 P.3d 1033 (2013).\n\u00a0 There was sufficient evidence to support the district court's finding that defendant was not acting to protect defendant's girlfriend where defendant's girlfriend was already the aggressor when defendant dragged victim by the hair to support defendant's conviction of harassment under subsection (1)(a).\u00a0 Further, defendant's girlfriend's ex-husband testified that defendant's girlfriend \"went for\" victim before defendant pulled victim by victim's hair, thus negating defendant's defense-of-others justification defense pursuant to \u00a7703-305.\u00a0 130 H. 332 (App.), 310 P.3d 1033 (2013).\n\u00a0 Mentioned:\u00a0 9 H. App. 315, 837 P.2d 1313 (1992); 79 H. 538 (App.), 904 P.2d 552 (1995).\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7711-1106 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 E.g., H.R.S. \u00a7772-2(5) and (10).\n\u00a0\n2.\u00a0 H.R.S. \u00a7759-2."
