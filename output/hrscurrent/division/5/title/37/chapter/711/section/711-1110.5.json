Evidence suggests a link between animal abuse and the commission of violent acts against humans.\u00a0 Hawaii is only one of nine states in the United States without a felony offense for domestic animal abuse.\u00a0 The legislature also found that pet animals provide a close emotional bond and relationship with their owners and family members and friends.\u00a0 Violence and harm committed against the animals have a significant emotional impact on their owners and family.\u00a0 The felony provisions of Act 114 protected pet animals.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 29.\n\u00a0 Act 128, Session Laws 2008, criminalized animal hoarding as a misdemeanor in \u00a7711-1109.6, and made conforming amendments to this section.\u00a0 Act 128 sunsets on July 1, 2011.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 45-08.\n\u00a0 Act 11, Session Laws 2009, provided for the reenactment of \u00a7711-1110.5 upon the repeal of Act 128, Session Laws 2008.\n\u00a0 Act 160, Session Laws 2009, extended the sunset date of Act 128, Session Laws 2008, relating to animal hoarding, [affecting this section,] from July 1, 2011 to July 1, 2015.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 85.\n\u00a0 Act 149, Session Laws 2011, amended this section by adding cruelty to animals by fighting dogs to the offenses that may force forfeiture of a dog.\u00a0 The legislature found that dogfighting is a brutal practice which often results in the death of the participating dogs within hours or days after the fight.\u00a0 Also, because dogs used for fighting have been bred for generations to be dangerously aggressive toward other animals, the presence of the dogs in a community increases the risk of attacks on not only other animals, but potentially on children, whose small size may cause a fighting dog to perceive a child as another animal.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 562, House Standing Committee Report No. 1098.\n\u00a0 Act 149, Session Laws 2011, also provided for the reenactment of \u00a7711-1110.5 upon the repeal of Act 128, Session Laws 2008, as amended by Act 160, Session Laws 2009."
