47 H. 361, 389 P.2d 439 (1964).\u00a0 See 39 H. 522 (1952).\n\u00a0 No appeal by State from ruling on question of law unless defendant convicted and appeals.\u00a0 34 H. 662 (1938).\n\u00a0 Oral ruling of district magistrate constitutes an order within the meaning of this section.\u00a0 41 H. 591 (1957).\n\u00a0 No right to review after acquittal of accused by verdict of jury.\u00a0 42 H. 102 (1957).\n\u00a0 Appeal by State from oral order of circuit court dismissing indictment is nugatory.\u00a0 45 H. 501, 370 P.2d 480 (1962).\n\u00a0 Pretrial order to suppress evidence; \"special plea in bar\" construed.\u00a0 50 H. 525, 445 P.2d 36 (1968).\n\u00a0 When State appeals from the quashing of an indictment, defendant is still subject to original requirements of bail.\u00a0 53 H. 76, 488 P.2d 329 (1971).\n\u00a0 Conditional discharge of defendant under \u00a7712-1255 is not a final disposition of the case appealable by the State.\u00a0 60 H. 576, 592 P.2d 832 (1979).\n\u00a0 Stipulation for joint hearing on motion to suppress and trial on merits is not a waiver by State of its right to appeal from ruling on motion to suppress.\u00a0 62 H. 44, 609 P.2d 131 (1980).\n\u00a0 Under circumstances, jeopardy did not attach even though jury was sworn.\u00a0 64 H. 395, 641 P.2d 1338 (1982).\n\u00a0 Jeopardy did not attach where case dismissed after defendant arraigned but before State's first witness sworn.\u00a0 68 H. 238, 709 P.2d 607 (1985).\n\u00a0 State could appeal only under paragraph (2) where case dismissed after all evidence taken.\u00a0 68 H. 653, 729 P.2d 385 (1986).\n\u00a0 Deferred acceptance of guilty and deferred acceptance of no contest pleas are not appealable.\u00a0 69 H. 438, 746 P.2d 568 (1987).\n\u00a0 Authorizes appellate jurisdiction to review orders granting pretrial motions to suppress.\u00a0 70 H. 206, 767 P.2d 1238 (1989).\n\u00a0 Language does not allow an appeal from a sentence on the ground that the sentence was imposed in an illegal manner, but allows an appeal from an illegal sentence.\u00a0 71 H. 624, 801 P.2d 558 (1990).\n\u00a0 State's right to appeal in criminal cases is limited to instances stated in section; section does not give State right to appeal from granting of deferred acceptance of guilty or deferred acceptance of no contest pleas.\u00a0 74 H. 75, 837 P.2d 776 (1992).\n\u00a0 While it is necessary for \"entire case\" to be dismissed for paragraph (2) to apply, there is nothing in the language of this section to indicate that this would prevent paragraph (1) from applying; prosecution not barred from bringing appeal of dismissal of counts of indictment, where counts dismissed after trial began because counts did not include essential elements of offenses charged.\u00a0 78 H. 373, 894 P.2d 70 (1995).\n\u00a0 In a jury trial, issues decided by the judge are \"questions of law\" appealable under this section, while issues decided by the jury are \"questions of fact\" and are not appealable.\u00a0 85 H. 462, 946 P.2d 32 (1997).\n\u00a0 As defendant's \"motion to dismiss\" following a jury verdict of guilty deemed post-verdict motion for judgment of acquittal following a jury verdict of guilty pursuant to HRPP rule 29(c), paragraph (9) authorized prosecution to assert appeal from this judgment of acquittal; thus, supreme court had appellate jurisdiction over appeal.\u00a0 87 H. 108, 952 P.2d 865 (1997).\n\u00a0 Double jeopardy clauses not violated by prosecution's appeal from judgment of acquittal following jury's verdict of guilty pursuant to paragraph (9).\u00a0 87 H. 108, 952 P.2d 865 (1997).\n\u00a0 Paragraph (1) permits prosecution to appeal from both dismissals with prejudice and without prejudice.\u00a0 87 H. 260, 953 P.2d 1358 (1998).\n\u00a0 Where trial court's order was an order of dismissal and not a judgment of acquittal, order was appealable under paragraph (1).\u00a0 97 H. 505, 40 P.3d 907 (2002).\n\u00a0 Paragraph (7) authorizes the prosecution to appeal orders suppressing evidence as illegally obtained, the intent of the statute being to facilitate the administration of justice in criminal cases by allowing the prosecution to obtain a conclusive ruling on issues involving searches, seizures, and confessions via direct appeal.\u00a0 104 H. 224, 87 P.3d 893 (2004).\n\u00a0 The language of paragraph (7), which allows the prosecution to appeal from \"a pretrial order granting a motion for the suppression of evidence\", includes within its scope the right to appeal from a trial court\u0092s voluntariness determination mandated by \u00a7621-26.\u00a0 104 H. 224, 87 P.3d 893 (2004).\n\u00a0 As district family court proceedings under \u00a7571-11(1) concerning juvenile law violators are considered to be noncriminal proceedings, prosecution's appeal of family court order was not authorized by paragraph (7).\u00a0 104 H. 403, 91 P.3d 485 (2004).\n\u00a0 As the prosecution was not authorized to appeal the judge's pretrial discovery order under this section, the prosecution, as mandamus petitioner, would have been without a remedy unless extraordinary relief was granted; where trial judge did not exceed judge's authority under HRPP rule 16(d) by ordering the disclosure of the information on the laser unit calibration distances and locations in prosecution of defendant for speeding, petition for writ of mandamus was denied.\u00a0 116 H. 23, 169 P.3d 975 (2007).\n\u00a0 Where the case was a criminal matter filed by plaintiff State of Hawaii against defendant and the police department (HPD) was not a party to the case, HPD, as a nonparty, was not authorized to appeal the respondent judge's order denying HPD's motion to quash defendant's subpoena duces tecum pursuant to \u00a7641-11 if judgment was entered against defendant; HPD was also not authorized to appeal the order pursuant to the interlocutory appeal statute for defendants, \u00a7641-17, or the appeal statute for the prosecution under this section; thus, having no remedy by way of appeal, HPD properly sought redress from the order by mandamus.\u00a0 122 H. 204, 225 P.3d 646 (2010).\n\u00a0 Deferred acceptance of no contest plea not appealable until no contest plea accepted.\u00a0 5 H. App. 357, 692 P.2d 1171 (1984).\n\u00a0 Section is to be strictly construed.\u00a0 7 H. App. 516, 782 P.2d 29 (1989).\n\u00a0 Paragraph (9) did not preclude appellate court's jurisdiction over State's appeal where trial court's judgment of acquittal was \"in form only and not in substance\"; trial court made no factual determination as to some or all of the elements charged, but grounded its ruling on the conclusion that the charges were defective as a matter of law.\u00a0 88 H. 477 (App.), 967 P.2d 674 (1998).\n\u00a0 Cited:\u00a0 37 H. 601, 603 (1947); 48 H. 247, 256, 397 P.2d 575 (1964)."
