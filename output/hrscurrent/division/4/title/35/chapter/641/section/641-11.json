Rev. 73 (1997).\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 For purposes of appeal, judgment of conviction is not final where it does not include any sentence.\u00a0 54 H. 485, 510 P.2d 88 (1973).\n\u00a0 Where no notice of judgment is given, period for filing appeal may be extended.\u00a0 56 H. 444, 540 P.2d 61 (1971).\n\u00a0 Failure of appointed counsel to give timely notice of appeal did not foreclose defendant's right to appeal.\u00a0 57 H. 268, 554 P.2d 236 (1976).\n\u00a0 Where there is no announcement of the decision and no notice of entry of judgment is given, time for filing notice of appeal does not run until notice is in fact received.\u00a0 59 H. 255, 580 P.2d 63 (1978).\n\u00a0 Review of denial of reduction of sentences proper since new standards of court discretion had been adopted.\u00a0 60 H. 309, 588 P.2d 927 (1979).\n\u00a0 Appeal permitted only from a final judgment or sentence.\u00a0 63 H. 9, 619 P.2d 1076 (1980).\n\u00a0 Jurisdictional defect in appeal cannot be waived by the parties or disregarded by the appellate court.\u00a0 63 H. 9, 619 P.2d 1076 (1980).\n\u00a0 Where charges against criminal defendant were dismissed, defendant was not an \"aggrieved party\" with standing to appeal an order approving partial fees.\u00a0 66 H. 366, 663 P.2d 630 (1983).\n\u00a0 Where defendants contended there was another exception to finality of judgment requirement of this section, specifically, that an order denying a motion to dismiss an indictment based on double jeopardy grounds fell into collateral order exception to final judgment rule, collateral order exception permitted an interlocutory appeal of an order denying a pretrial motion to dismiss an indictment on double jeopardy grounds.\u00a0 77 H. 351, 884 P.2d 729 (1994).\n\u00a0 Supreme court lacked appellate jurisdiction to hear defendant's appeal of defendant's acquittal on count III kidnapping where defendant was not an \"aggrieved\" party within the meaning of this section; because defendant would remain under health director's custody based on trial court's acquittals as to counts I and II, which would have warranted convictions but for defendant's affirmative defense of insanity, defendant was not aggrieved by trial court's acquittal on count III as acquittal did not adversely impact defendant's rights.\u00a0 102 H. 130, 73 P.3d 668 (2003).\n\u00a0 Where the case was a criminal matter filed by plaintiff State of Hawaii against defendant and the police department (HPD) was not a party to the case, HPD, as a nonparty, was not authorized to appeal the respondent judge's order denying HPD's motion to quash defendant's subpoena duces tecum pursuant to this section if judgment was entered against defendant; HPD was also not authorized to appeal the order pursuant to the interlocutory appeal statute for defendants, \u00a7641-17, or the appeal statute for the prosecution, \u00a7641-13; thus, having no remedy by way of appeal, HPD properly sought redress from the order by mandamus.\u00a0 122 H. 204, 225 P.3d 646 (2010).\n\u00a0 Defendant not \"aggrieved party\" with standing to appeal order granting partial fees.\u00a0 6 H. App. 20, 709 P.2d 105 (1985).\n\u00a0 Appellate court lacked jurisdiction under this section and HRAP rule 4(b) where defendant failed to appeal within the thirty-day time period mandated; defendant's motion to withdraw no contest plea did not \"reopen\" final judgment such that order denying defendant's motion became the appealable final judgment under this section and HRAP rule 4(b).\u00a0 96 H. 462 (App.), 32 P.3d 106 (2001)."
