App. 578, 855 P.2d 34 (1993).\n\u00a0 Because trial court did not apply appropriate sentencing standards to extended term motion and remand would allow circuit court to reconsider other sentencing alternatives in fashioning an appropriate sentence, modification of sentence was not warranted on appeal.\u00a0 77 H. 340 (App.), 884 P.2d 403 (1994).\n\u00a0 Modification of sentence on appeal warranted where district court, on resentencing, failed to take into account time defendant already served in prison, amount of fines paid, and community service completed.\u00a0 82 H. 83 (App.), 919 P.2d 995 (1996).\n\u00a0\nPrejudicial error as requisite.\n\u00a0 No reversal unless error prejudicial, 43 H. 119 (1959); 44 H. 10, 352 P.2d 320 (1959); 45 H. 295, 367 P.2d 499 (1961); 45 H. 457, 370 P.2d 468 (1962); 46 H. 127, 376 P.2d 125 (1962); 47 H. 185, 199, 389 P.2d 146 (1963); 49 H. 77, 102, 412 P.2d 669 (1966); 49 H. 116, 412 P.2d 662 (1966). \u00a0Erroneous instruction presumptively harmful.\u00a0 49 H. 327, 330, 417 P.2d 638 (1966).\u00a0 Error that is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt does not mandate reversal of conviction.\u00a0 57 H. 26, 548 P.2d 1402 (1976).\n\u00a0 For earlier cases see notes to RLH 1955, \u00a7\u00a7210-1, 212-14.\n\u00a0\nPreservation of error as requisite.\n\u00a0 Questions on appeal must have been raised below.\u00a0 43 H. 299, 301 (1959); 44 H. 370, 355 P.2d 25 (1960); 45 H. 83, 88, 363 P.2d 964, 967 (1961); 46 H. 475, 485, 382 P.2d 920, 934 (1963); 49 H. 1, 406 P.2d 887 (1965); 49 H. 42, 45, 410 P.2d 976 (1966); 50 H. 253, 438 P.2d 401 (1968).\u00a0 But see as to fundamental error.\u00a0 49 H. 504, 421 P.2d 305 (1966); 49 H. 522, 528, 423 P.2d 438 (1967); 50 H. 287, 439 P.2d 666 (1968).\u00a0 For earlier cases see notes to RLH 1955, \u00a7\u00a7208-3, 210-1, 212-1, 212-4, 212-8, 212-14.\u00a0 Though generally judgment will be reversed only on theory presented to trial court, there may be deviations when justice requires.\u00a0 53 H. 45, 487 P.2d 1070 (1971).\u00a0 Court has power to notice plain errors not raised at trial if they affect substantial rights.\u00a0 Specific grounds for objection are required.\u00a0 56 H. 343, 537 P.2d 724 (1975).\u00a0 Objection to admission of evidence is necessary; objection on specific ground is a waiver of all other objections.\u00a0 57 H. 96, 550 P.2d 900 (1976).\n\u00a0\nScope of review of factual issues.\n\u00a0 Test on criminal appeals is whether verdict is supported by substantial evidence.\u00a0 55 H. 1, 514 P.2d 373 (1973).\n\u00a0 See notes to \u00a7635-56.\u00a0 Cited:\u00a0 47 H. 472, 478, 391 P.2d 403 (1964), note 1."
