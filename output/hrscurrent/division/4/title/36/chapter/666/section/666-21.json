[L 1984, c 211, \u00a71; am L 1989, c 211, \u00a710; am L 1990, c 281, \u00a711; am L 2012, c 142, \u00a711; am L 2013, c 116, \u00a7\u00a719, 25(18)]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Assuming that possession of leased premises and rent to be paid into the trust fund are property interests protected under the due process clause, this section does not offend due process as tenants are afforded an opportunity to challenge summary possession and motions for the establishment of a rent trust fund.\u00a0 107 H. 73, 110 P.3d 397 (2005).\n\u00a0 As the imposition of a rent trust fund--requiring tenants to pay rent in exchange for possession for the duration of the dispute--appears rationally related to achieving the purpose of providing landlords with an expeditious alternative to eviction proceedings and tenants with an opportunity to maintain possession so long as rent is paid when properly due, this section does not violate the equal protection clauses of the U.S. and Hawaii Constitutions.\u00a0 107 H. 73, 110 P.3d 397 (2005).\n\u00a0 Before ordering that a rent trust fund pursuant to this section be established, the trial court should have held a hearing on the claim of defendant, as tenant of outdoor spaces rented to tenant by plaintiff, that defendant was not allowed to take possession of the spaces.\u00a0 107 H. 73, 110 P.3d 397 (2005)."
