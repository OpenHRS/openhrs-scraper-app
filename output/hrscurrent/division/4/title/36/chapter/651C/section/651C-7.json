[L 1985, c 216, pt of \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Action in which plaintiff made fraudulent transfer claims under the Hawaii uniform fraudulent transfer act, seeking to avoid the transfer of real property to the extent necessary to satisfy plaintiff's claims and/or to grant plaintiff other relief under subsection (a), was an appropriate subject of a lis pendens under the Hawaii doctrine of lis pendens, codified in \u00a7634-51.\u00a0 457 F. Supp. 2d 1121 (2006).\n\u00a0 Petitioners were entitled to a variety of means (\u00a7\u00a7651C-8 and 651C-10 and this section) to secure a full recovery of their losses from respondent and/or the asset fraudulently transferred to respondent, but only once, not twice; moreover, nothing in this chapter requires petitioners to elect one remedy over another.\u00a0 This chapter does not, however, allow petitioners recovery of both the asset transferred (regardless of its value) and, in addition, a judgment in the full amount of their damages.\u00a0 130 H. 58 (App.), 305 P.3d 474 (2013)."
