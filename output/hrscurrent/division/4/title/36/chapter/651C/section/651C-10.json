[L 1985, c 216, pt of \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Petitioners were entitled to a variety of means (\u00a7\u00a7651C-7 and 651C-8 and this section) to secure a full recovery of their losses from respondent and/or the asset fraudulently transferred to respondent, but only once, not twice; moreover, nothing in this chapter requires petitioners to elect one remedy over another.\u00a0 This chapter does not, however, allow petitioners recovery of both the asset transferred (regardless of its value) and, in addition, a judgment in the full amount of their damages.\u00a0 130 H. 58 (App.), 305 P.3d 474 (2013)."
