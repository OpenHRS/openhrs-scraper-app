[L 2001, c 265, pt of \u00a71; am L 2002, c 50, \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nRevision Note\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \"July 1, 2002\" substituted for \"the effective date of this chapter\".\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Where appellant was already bound by an arbitration agreement executed on February 24, 2000, and therefore the post-July 1, 2002 arbitration agreement was not a \"new\" arbitration agreement that would dictate the application of this chapter to the arbitration proceedings, subsection (a) was inapplicable to the case.\u00a0 113 H. 127, 149 P.3d 495 (2006).\n\u00a0 Where arbitration proceeding commenced prior to June 30, 2004, subsection (c) was inapplicable to the case; thus, under the circumstances of the case and the plain language of subsection (b), the governing law applicable to the arbitration proceeding was chapter 658.\u00a0 113 H. 127, 149 P.3d 495 (2006).\n\u00a0 Where the agreement to arbitrate was executed on February 24, 2000 and the arbitration proceeding commenced on February 18, 2004, that is, prior to June 30, 2004 but after June 30, 2002, pursuant to the plain reading of the alternative stated in the second sentence of subsection (b), the governing law applicable to the arbitration proceeding was the law that was in effect on June 30, 2002, i.e., chapter 658.\u00a0 113 H. 127, 149 P.3d 495 (2006).\n\u00a0 To the extent that there may be a conflict between the jurisdictional provisions of this chapter and chapter 89, chapter 89 takes precedence over this chapter.\u00a0 132 H. 492 (App.), 323 P.3d 136 (2014)."
