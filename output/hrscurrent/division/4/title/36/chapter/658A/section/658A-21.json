[L 2001, c 265, pt of \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 The plain language of subsection (b) and its related commentary from the Uniform Arbitration Act established that awards of attorneys' fees can be valid and authorized based on a party agreement, even if the resulting award exceeds the twenty-five per cent of the judgment limitation included in \u00a7607-14.\u00a0 123 H. 476, 236 P.3d 456 (2010).\n\u00a0 Where the determination of the reasonableness of the attorneys' fees was clearly within the scope of the arbitrator's authority and could not be vacated or modified by a reviewing court simply based on the argument that the award was unreasonable, the arbitrators' award of attorneys' fees well in excess of twenty-five per cent of the principal and interest amount of the award was not unreasonable and the arbitrators did not exceed their powers.\u00a0 121 H. 110 (App.), 214 P.3d 1100 (2009).\n\u00a0 Cited:\u00a0 654 F. Supp. 2d 1142 (2009)."
