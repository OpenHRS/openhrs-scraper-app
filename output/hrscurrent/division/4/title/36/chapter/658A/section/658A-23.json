[L 2001, c 265, pt of \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Plaintiff contended that district court erred in granting defendant's motion to confirm and denying plaintiff's motion to vacate the arbitration award because the arbitrator was biased against plaintiff and failed to follow the law; confirmation of the arbitration award and denial of the motion to vacate the award, affirmed.\u00a0 603 F.3d 676 (2010).\n\u00a0 In the narrow circumstances of the case, perjury may constitute a basis for vacating an arbitration award.\u00a0 126 H. 99 (App.), 267 P.3d 683 (2011).\n\u00a0 Where defendant failed to allege or establish that the arbitration award itself--i.e., awarding damages in favor of plaintiff--violated any public policy, and alleged that the arbitrator's findings and conclusions were tainted by plaintiff's perjury, the statutory grounds embodied in subsection (a) provided sufficient recourse to vacate awards for fraud, including perjury, and the public policy exception was inapplicable to the case.\u00a0 126 H. 99 (App.), 267 P.3d 683 (2011).\n\u00a0 Section provides authority for relief from an arbitration award, but not from a final judgment on an order confirming an arbitration award.\u00a0 131 H. 301 (App.), 318 P.3d 591 (2013).\n\u00a0 The arbitrator was expressly authorized by the collective bargaining agreement to award \"back pay to compensate the teacher wholly ... for any salary lost\" and interpreted the provision to allow interest for the time that the teacher was without pay.\u00a0 Even if the arbitrator incorrectly construed the agreement or misinterpreted applicable law, the arbitrator acted within the arbitrator's power to interpret the agreement and fashion a remedy in accordance with the arbitrator's interpretation.\u00a0 131 H. 301 (App.), 318 P.3d 591 (2013)."
