[L 2001, c 265, pt of \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Cited, where the court found that third-party defendant, assignee and nonsignatory to a lease containing a valid arbitration clause, could move to compel arbitration of additional rent due.\u00a0 515 F. Supp. 2d 1141 (2007).\n\u00a0 Although public workers' union was not engaged in arbitration proceedings at the time of the other public union's motion to compel consolidated arbitration pursuant to this section, as the core purpose of the other public union's motion was to compel arbitration, appeals court had jurisdiction under \u00a7658A-28 over other public union's appeal from order denying motion for consolidated arbitration.\u00a0 124 H. 372 (App.), 244 P.3d 609 (2010).\n\u00a0 Where public workers' union and the State had a valid agreement to arbitrate disputes that arose between the State and the union workers, but the agreement did not contemplate arbitration for disputes with the other public union, a nonsignatory to the agreement, circuit court did not err in refusing to compel tripartite arbitration.\u00a0 124 H. 372 (App.), 244 P.3d 609 (2010).\n\u00a0 Upon a disputed motion to compel arbitration, where there are genuine issues of material fact as to the existence of an arbitration agreement, a trial court must resolve those issues through an evidentiary hearing; at minimum, where live witness testimony or cross examination of affiants would meaningfully promote resolution of factual disputes, such evidence should be received, as disputed factual issues cannot be resolved on the basis of an under-developed record.\u00a0 130 H. 517 (App.), 312 P.3d 1224 (2013)."
