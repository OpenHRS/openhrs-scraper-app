[L 2001, c 265, pt of \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 The first circuit court did not err in finding that it was the proper venue for the proceedings to confirm the arbitration award where, inter alia, the collective bargaining agreement provided that the arbitrator had the authority to fix the date, time and place of the hearing, and the judge determined that the arbitration was properly held in Honolulu where the arbitrator was located.\u00a0 125 H. 476 (App.), 264 P.3d 655 (2011)."
