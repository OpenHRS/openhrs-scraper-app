Rev. 55 (1992).\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Medical claim conciliation panel requirement is procedural rather than substantive, and does not apply to cases filed in federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction.\u00a0 29 F. Supp. 2d 1174 (1998).\n\u00a0 Claim was allowed to be heard because there was substantial compliance with procedural requirements.\u00a0 69 H. 305, 741 P.2d 1280 (1987).\n\u00a0 Where certain counts of plaintiff's complaint alleged errors or omissions in professional practice by a health care provider, thus falling under the definition of \"medical tort\" under \u00a7671-1(2), court properly ruled plaintiff could not proceed with those counts of suit without first submitting them to medical claim conciliation panel as required by \u00a7671-16 and this section.\u00a0 89 H. 188, 970 P.2d 496 (1998).\n\u00a0 Where plaintiff chose to sidestep requirements of \u00a7671-16 and this section by filing suit before seeking resolution of claims by a medical claim conciliation panel as required under these statutes, court properly dismissed complaint.\u00a0 89 H. 188, 970 P.2d 496 (1998).\n\u00a0 Where medical claim conciliation panel decision was filed after commencement of plaintiffs' suit in trial court, plaintiffs failed to comply with the requirements of this section; thus, trial court did not err in concluding it had no subject matter jurisdiction.\u00a0 90 H. 425, 978 P.2d 863 (1999).\n\u00a0 Subsection (a) requires only that a claimant set forth facts upon which the claim is based and include the names of all parties against whom the claim is or may be made who are then known to the claimant; nowhere in this section does it require plaintiffs to name all known negligent health care providers; having filed the requisite medical claim conciliation panel claim, participated in the required hearing, and rejected the panel's finding of no actionable negligence, plaintiffs satisfied this chapter's statutory prerequisites for filing suit in circuit court.\u00a0 111 H. 74, 137 P.3d 980 (2006).\n\u00a0 Where defendants city, city department of health, and city director of health fit within the definition of \"health care facility\" under \u00a7323D-2 and \"health care provider\" under \u00a7671-1, and as to them, each of the eight counts alleged a \"medical tort\", plaintiff was required to submit the eight counts against them to the medical claim conciliation panel pursuant to this section as a precondition to filing suit.\u00a0 93 H. 490 (App.), 6 P.3d 362 (2000).\n\u00a0 Circuit court properly dismissed plaintiff's claims for lack of jurisdiction where, although plaintiff was not the patient in the case, plaintiff's allegations arose directly from an alleged medical tort involving plaintiff's son, a patient, and subsection (a) states that \"any person\" must submit a statement of the claim to the medical claim conciliation panel before a suit based on that claim may be commenced in any state court.\u00a0 121 H. 235 (App.), 216 P.3d 1258 (2009).\n\u00a0 Plaintiff's claims of neglect, abuse, and failure to provide a safe home against care home defendants did not constitute \"medical torts\" within the meaning of \u00a7671-1; thus, plaintiff was not required to submit plaintiff's claims to a medical claim conciliation panel (MCCP) pursuant to this section and \u00a7671-16 as a condition for plaintiff to file suit against defendants, and the circuit court erred in dismissing plaintiff's suit based on plaintiff's failure to submit plaintiff's claims to a MCCP.\u00a0 128 H. 405 (App.), 289 P.3d 1041 (2012)."
