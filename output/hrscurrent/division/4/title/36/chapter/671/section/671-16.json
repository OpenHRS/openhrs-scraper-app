[L 1976, c 219, pt of \u00a72; am L 1980, c 88, \u00a73; am L 2003, c 211, \u00a73 ; am L 2012, c 296, pt of \u00a74]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Claim was allowed to be heard because there was substantial compliance with procedural requirements.\u00a0 69 H. 305, 741 P.2d 1280 (1987).\n\u00a0 Where certain counts of plaintiff's complaint alleged errors or omissions in professional practice by a health care provider, thus falling under the definition of \"medical tort\" under \u00a7671-1(2), court properly ruled plaintiff could not proceed with those counts of suit without first submitting them to medical claim conciliation panel as required by \u00a7671-12 and this section.\u00a0 89 H. 188, 970 P.2d 496 (1998).\n\u00a0 Where plaintiff chose to sidestep requirements of \u00a7671-12 and this section by filing suit before seeking resolution of claims by a medical claim conciliation panel as required under these statutes, court properly dismissed complaint.\u00a0 89 H. 188, 970 P.2d 496 (1998).\n\u00a0 Plaintiff's claims of neglect, abuse, and failure to provide a safe home against care home defendants did not constitute \"medical torts\" within the meaning of \u00a7671-1; thus, plaintiff was not required to submit plaintiff's claims to a medical claim conciliation panel (MCCP) pursuant to \u00a7671-12 and this section as a condition for plaintiff to file suit against defendants, and the circuit court erred in dismissing plaintiff's suit based on plaintiff's failure to submit plaintiff's claims to a MCCP.\u00a0 128 H. 405 (App.), 289 P.3d 1041 (2012)."
