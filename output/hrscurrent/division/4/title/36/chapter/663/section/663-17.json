Supp. 854 (1968).\n\u00a0 Right of contribution, when it becomes enforceable.\u00a0 283 F. Supp. 854 (1968).\n\u00a0 Cited, where a defendant filed a motion for summary judgment against plaintiff's claims and filed cross-claims against co-defendants, who filed an opposition to the motion, but did not file a cross-claim against the defendant, and plaintiff filed a statement of no position regarding the motion; the court found the right of the co-defendants to oppose the motion was sustainable under the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act and HRCP rule 15(b).\u00a0 415 F. Supp. 2d 1163 (2006).\n\u00a0 Minor son of plaintiff may be subject to contribution to defendant as joint tortfeasor.\u00a0 51 H. 74, 450 P.2d 998 (1969).\n\u00a0 Parents are liable for torts to their minor children, and they may be joined as joint tortfeasors in action by children against third party.\u00a0 51 H. 484, 462 P.2d 1007 (1969).\n\u00a0 Plaintiff's wife may be impleaded by defendant, notwithstanding the interspousal tort immunity law.\u00a0 68 H. 505, 720 P.2d 181 (1986).\n\u00a0 Based on \u00a7663-12 and subsection (c), because joint tortfeasor landlord did not file a cross-claim against joint tortfeasor tenant, landlord did not have a right of contribution from tenant, and trial court properly acted within its discretion in dismissing tenant from the case.\u00a0 93 H. 417, 5 P.3d 407 (2000).\n\u00a0 Where bar owners failed to litigate the issue of proportionate fault with bar customer by pleading the customer into the case by filing a third-party complaint against the customer pursuant to \u00a7663-12, under subsection (c), the bar owners were barred from having \"the relative degrees of fault of the joint tortfeasors considered in determining their pro rata shares\"; thus, because the customer could not have been included on the special verdict form as a matter of law, the appeals court erred in concluding to the contrary.\u00a0 118 H. 385, 191 P.3d 1062 (2008)."
