[L 1955, c 205, \u00a72; RL 1955, \u00a7246-6; HRS \u00a7663-7; am L 1972, c 144, \u00a72(f)]\n\u00a0\nCross References\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Abatement and revival, see chapter 634, pt V.\n\u00a0 Probate, claims, see chapter 560.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Recovery by estate of decedent for decedent's pain and suffering.\u00a0 245 F. Supp. 981, 1015 (1965), aff'd 381 F.2d 965 (1967).\n\u00a0 Because decedent would have had an action for punitive damages had decedent survived, estate is entitled to recover punitive damages under this section.\u00a0 551 F. Supp. 110 (1982).\n\u00a0 Recovery for decedent's conscious pain and suffering, discussed.\u00a0 823 F. Supp. 778 (1993).\n\u00a0 In action under Federal Tort Claims Act, where plaintiffs argued, inter alia, that remaining individual plaintiffs were all legally entitled to assert a survivorship claim on behalf of estate under this section because they were all deceased's heirs, remaining individual plaintiffs' status as heirs did not, by itself, entitle them to be legal representatives of estate.\u00a0 125 F. Supp. 2d 1243 (2000).\n\u00a0 Probable earnings of decedent during decedent's lost years are not a proper item of damages.\u00a0 54 H. 231, 505 P.2d 1169 (1973).\u00a0 But for present statutory rule, see \u00a7663-8.\n\u00a0 A person named in will of decedent to be the executrix deemed \"legal representative\" and would have been proper person to be substituted for decedent in action brought by decedent.\u00a0 60 H. 125, 588 P.2d 416 (1978).\n\u00a0\u00a0As murder victim would have had a claim for punitive damages had murder victim survived, under this section, victim's claim for punitive damages survived victim's death; as this claim survives victim's death, punitive damages are not recoverable in an action under \u00a7663-3.\u00a0 87 H. 273 (App.), 954 P.2d 652 (1998).\n\u00a0 Where murder victim would have had cause of action for loss of enjoyment of life and other nonpecuniary losses under \u00a7663-8.5 had murder victim survived, under this section, victim's claim survived victim's death and victim's estate may sue for such damages.\u00a0 87 H. 273 (App.), 954 P.2d 652 (1998)."
