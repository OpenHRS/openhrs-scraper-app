Rev. 55 (1992).\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a7663-31\u00a0 Contributory negligence no bar; comparative negligence; findings of fact and special verdicts.\u00a0 (a)\u00a0 Contributory negligence shall not bar recovery in any action by any person or the person's legal representative to recover damages for negligence resulting in death or in injury to person or property, if such negligence was not greater than the negligence of the person or in the case of more than one person, the aggregate negligence of such persons against whom recovery is sought, but any damages allowed shall be diminished in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the person for whose injury, damage or death recovery is made.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b)\u00a0 In any action to which subsection (a) of this section applies, the court, in a nonjury trial, shall make findings of fact or, in a jury trial, the jury shall return a special verdict which shall state:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 The amount of the damages which would have been recoverable if there had been no contributory negligence; and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 The degree of negligence of each party, expressed as a percentage.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (c)\u00a0 Upon the making of the findings of fact or the return of a special verdict, as is contemplated by subsection (b) above, the court shall reduce the amount of the award in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the person for whose injury, damage or death recovery is made; provided that if the said proportion is greater than the negligence of the person or in the case of more than one person, the aggregate negligence of such persons against whom recovery is sought, the court will enter a judgment for the defendant.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (d)\u00a0 The court shall instruct the jury regarding the law of comparative negligence where appropriate.

Taas Associates:\u00a0 Limits on Dram Shop Liability; Barring Recovery of Bar Patrons, Their Estates and Survivors.\u00a0 11 UH L. Rev. 277 (1989).\n\u00a0 Ozaki and Comparative Negligence:\u00a0 Imposing Joint Liability Where a Duty to Protect or Prevent Harm from Third Party Intentional Tortfeasors Exits Is Fairer to Plaintiffs and Defendants.\u00a0 26 UH L. Rev. 575 (2004).\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 In Federal Tort Claims Act action against United States of America for damages for personal injuries plaintiffs sustained when they were scalded by lava heated ocean water, judgment to be entered in favor of the government, where court found, inter alia, that because plaintiffs knowingly entered a closed area with an open and obvious hazard, not only was their behavior unreasonable, but they alone were responsible for their injuries.\u00a0 73 F. Supp. 2d 1172 (1999).\n\u00a0 Comparative negligence doctrine will not be applied to claims accruing before July 14, 1969.\u00a0 51 H. 636, 466 P.2d 429 (1970).\n\u00a0 Comparative negligence applies only to claims accruing after July 14, 1969, and the rule of contributory negligence continues on claims that accrued before that date.\u00a0 52 H. 129, 471 P.2d 524 (1970).\n\u00a0 Contributory negligence is available as defense against claims accruing before July 14, 1969.\u00a0 55 H. 375, 520 P.2d 62 (1974).\n\u00a0 Costs allowable to prevailing party not subject to reduction in proportion to negligence attributable.\u00a0 56 H. 613, 546 P.2d 1013 (1976).\n\u00a0 Section does not affect action between two joint tortfeasors under \u00a7\u00a7663-11 to 663-17.\u00a0 65 H. 428, 653 P.2d 96 (1982).\n\u00a0 Comparative negligence principles not applicable to strict liability case.\u00a0 69 H. 176, 738 P.2d 79 (1987).\n\u00a0 Contributory negligence is no longer a complete defense or total bar to a tort claim; legislature, in enacting comparative negligence statute did not intend to alter judicially created derivative action for loss of consortiums.\u00a0 69 H. 192, 738 P.2d 85 (1987).\n\u00a0 Pure comparative negligence principles apply to strict products liability claims.\u00a0 69 H. 231, 738 P.2d 416 (1987).\n\u00a0 Section required that judgment be entered for defendant where jury's special verdict apportioned greater fault to victim than to defendant.\u00a0 87 H. 265, 954 P.2d 644 (1998).\n\u00a0 Where arbitrator's award apportioned liabilities in passenger's action against passenger's driver and driver of other vehicle as seventy per cent to thirty per cent negligent respectively, and arbitrator's award had collateral estoppel effect, subsection (a) barred recovery by passenger's driver in separate action against other driver.\u00a0 90 H. 143, 976 P.2d 904 (1999).\n\u00a0 The known or obvious danger defense is inconsistent with the legislative intent behind Hawaii's comparative negligence statute, yields inconsistent results, and is incompatible with the policy values underlying Hawaii's tort law; thus, the known or obvious danger defense is no longer viable in Hawaii; the Restatement's retention of the doctrine as a factor in determining the landowner's duty is rejected, and the courts of this State may consider any known or obvious characteristics of the danger as factors in the larger comparative negligence analysis.\u00a0 126 H. 133, 267 P.3d 1238 (2011).\n\u00a0 Instructions to jury.\u00a0 1 H. App 94, 614 P.2d 402 (1980).\n\u00a0 Comparative negligence and products liability doctrines merged; in products liability case injured plaintiff cannot recover if more negligent than defendant.\u00a0 6 H. App. 652, 736 P.2d 440 (1987).\n\u00a0 Because this section clearly permits apportionment of damages and no justification exists to maintain doctrine of last clear chance, use of doctrine by a plaintiff abolished.\u00a0 83 H. 78 (App.), 924 P.2d 572 (1996).\n\u00a0 Trial court should have instructed jury on law of comparative negligence and failure to do so made jury instructions that were given prejudicially insufficient.\u00a0 83 H. 78 (App.), 924 P.2d 572 (1996).\n\u00a0 In light of the plain language of HAR rule 23(a), trial court abused its discretion when it sanctioned defendant by apportioning defendant's and plaintiff's negligence based on arbitrator's award, and the apportionment sanction deprived defendant of a jury determination as to the degree of negligence of the parties, in violation of this section.\u00a0 99 H. 432 (App.), 56 P.3d 734 (2002).\n\u00a0 Cited:\u00a0 60 H. 381, 590 P.2d 564 (1979).\n\u00a0 Discussed:\u00a0 781 F. Supp. 2d 1025 (2011)."
