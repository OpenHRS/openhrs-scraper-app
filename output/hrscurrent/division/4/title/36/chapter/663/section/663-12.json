[L 1941, c 24, \u00a72; RL 1945, \u00a710488; RL 1955, \u00a7246-11; HRS \u00a7663-12; am L 1972, c 144, \u00a72(g); gen ch 1985]\n\u00a0\nLaw Journals and Reviews\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Keeping the (Good) Faith:\u00a0 Hawai\u0091i's Good Faith Settlement After HRS Section 15.5 and Troyer v. Adams.\u00a0 26 UH L. Rev. 275 (2003).\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Right of contribution, ripens when.\u00a0 283 F. Supp. 854 (1968).\n\u00a0 Settlement did not bar defendant's contribution rights against State where settlement extinguished State's liability to plaintiffs; apportionment of fault where negligent employee, acting for both joint tortfeasors, performed services primarily benefiting one tortfeasor.\u00a0 643 F. Supp. 593 (1986).\n\u00a0 Party was not allowed to recover as a joint tortfeasor.\u00a0 682 F. Supp. 1499 (1988).\n\u00a0 Cited, where a defendant filed a motion for summary judgment against plaintiff's claims and filed cross-claims against co-defendants, who filed an opposition to the motion, but did not file a cross-claim against the defendant, and plaintiff filed a statement of no position regarding the motion; the court found the right of the co-defendants to oppose the motion was sustainable under the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act and HRCP rule 15(b).\u00a0 415 F. Supp. 2d 1163 (2006).\n\u00a0 In reviewing apportionment of damages, supreme court should confine its question to whether apportionment was so erroneous as to shock the moral sense.\u00a0 45 H. 128, 363 P.2d 969 (1961).\n\u00a0 A party who settles before suit and is found not negligent in action for contribution is not a joint tortfeasor and is therefore not entitled to contribution but may recover under subrogation.\u00a0 53 H. 398, 495 P.2d 585 (1972).\n\u00a0 Based on \u00a7663-17(c) and this section, because joint tortfeasor landlord did not file a cross-claim against joint tortfeasor tenant, landlord did not have a right of contribution from tenant, and trial court properly acted within its discretion in dismissing tenant from the case.\u00a0 93 H. 417, 5 P.3d 407 (2000).\n\u00a0 Where bar owners failed to litigate the issue of proportionate fault with bar customer by pleading the customer into the case by filing a third-party complaint against the customer pursuant to this section, under \u00a7663-17(c), the bar owners were barred from having \"the relative degrees of fault of the joint tortfeasors considered in determining their pro rata shares\"; thus, because the customer could not have been included on the special verdict form as a matter of law, the appeals court erred in concluding to the contrary.\u00a0 118 H. 385, 191 P.3d 1062 (2008).\n\u00a0 Form of final judgment with respect to joint tortfeasor's claim for contribution.\u00a0 6 H. App. 664, 737 P.2d 871 (1987).\n\u00a0 Condominium association jointly and severally liable with murderer under this section as section provides for apportionment of the common liability of joint tortfeasors as among themselves but does not affect the joint and several liability of each defendant toward plaintiff.\u00a0 87 H. 273 (App.), 954 P.2d 652 (1998).\n\u00a0 When conduct of all joint tortfeasors is not sufficiently culpable to justify award of punitive damages against each tortfeasor, such damages may not be the subject of contribution among joint tortfeasors.\u00a0 87 H. 273 (App.), 954 P.2d 652 (1998)."
