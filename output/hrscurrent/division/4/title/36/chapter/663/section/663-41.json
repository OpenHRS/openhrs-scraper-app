[L 2003, c 69, pt of \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 There was actually no indication that this section was meant to encompass the instant factual situation where the injury was inflicted directly upon the minor by the host (defendant) through the provision of alcohol, and the claim was only between the minor and the host; thus, this section does not apply in a case where the intoxicated minor has not caused damage or injury to an innocent third party, and therefore did not bar the claims made by plaintiff (parents of decedent minor) against defendant.\u00a0 130 H. 282, 308 P.3d 911 (2013)."
