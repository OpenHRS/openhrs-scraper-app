Rev. 611 (2012).\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\nGenerally.\n\u00a0 Where plaintiffs argued that State waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity through the enactment of \u00a7353-14 and the State's Tort Claims Act [sic], \u00a7662-2 and this section, no express consent or applicable waiver provisions found.\u00a0 940 F. Supp. 1523 (1996).\n\u00a0 Where the proper inquiry in this jurisdiction for the assignability of a claim for relief is whether the cause of action alleges a personal injury or an injury to property, and the complaint asserted non-personal injuries, the professional malpractice, breach of fiduciary duty, and fraud claims were assignable.\u00a0 113 H. 373, 153 P.3d 444 (2007).\n\u00a0 Insurer's preferred provider plan did not manifest an intent by the parties to submit to arbitration insured's claims seeking monetary damages for breach of contract, bad faith, and intentional or negligent infliction of emotional distress where, considering all its relevant parts, the plan's provisions (only) meant that arbitration was one of two options an insured may select--arbitration or review by a panel appointed by the insurance commissioner--to challenge or dispute the insurer's determination, action or decision that the insured seeks to change.\u00a0 124 H. 172 (App.), 238 P.3d 699 (2010).\n\u00a0\nBad faith.\n\u00a0 Hawaii supreme court, seeking to avoid inequitable or absurd result, would allow plaintiff's bad faith claim, where plaintiff submitted claims to defendant insurer for losses suffered as a third-party beneficiary of insurance contract.\u00a0 947 F. Supp. 429 (1996).\n\u00a0 Independent cause of action for breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing would not lie, where there was no coverage liability on underlying insurance policy.\u00a0 955 F. Supp. 1218 (1997).\n\u00a0 Where defendant contended that claim for breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing was barred by two-year statute of limitations governing damage to persons and property (\u00a7657-7), since there is no element in the cause of action for bad faith that requires a plaintiff to suffer personal injury, it is not in reality a cause of action based upon a \"personal injury\", and the applicable statute of limitations is six years and is found in the catchall provision of \u00a7657-1 (\u00a7657-1(4)).\u00a0 986 F. Supp. 1334 (1997).\n\u00a0 Limitations period applicable to cause of action for bad faith, discussed; where complaint was not filed until almost one year after the limitations period had lapsed, to the extent that complaint alleged a claim for the tort of bad faith denial of benefits, summary judgment granted in favor of defendant as to plaintiff's claim for tort of bad faith.\u00a0 11 F. Supp. 2d 1204 (1998).\n\u00a0 Violations of the unfair settlement provision, \u00a7431:13-103(a), may be used as evidence to indicate bad faith in accordance with the guidelines of Best Place, Inc. v. Penn America Ins. Co.\u00a0 27 F. Supp. 2d 1211 (1998).\n\u00a0 Plaintiff failed to exhaust the administrative remedies provided to plaintiff by chapter 386; prior to filing a separate suit for bad faith denial of benefits or payments, plaintiff must first exhaust all available administrative remedies before the department of labor and industrial relations, disability compensation division.\u00a0 28 F. Supp. 2d 588 (1997).\n\u00a0 Insurer's motion granted to extent it sought summary judgment as to claims against defendant, where uncontradicted evidence was that defendant was the claims handler for subject insurance policy; defendant did not have a contract with plaintiffs; defendant could not be liable to plaintiffs for bad faith.\u00a0 74 F. Supp. 2d 975 (1999).\n\u00a0 Insurer's motion for summary judgment granted on defendant's counterclaim alleging that insurer acted in tortious breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by, among other things, its failure to pay underinsured motorist policy benefits, improper use of \"excuse\" that defendant violated consent-to-settle clause, and wrongful pursuit of its offset theory.\u00a0 176 F. Supp. 2d 1005 (2001).\n\u00a0 Hawaii's Best Place bad faith tort is law that impacts insurance, but does not solely regulate it; therefore, plaintiff's claim as stated arising under Best Place bad faith tort did not fit within Employee Retirement Income Security Act's (ERISA) saving clause.\u00a0 Controlling precedent mandated that plaintiff's claim was related to the processing of a claim and was preempted by ERISA because ERISA's civil remedy was plaintiff's sole avenue of relief.\u00a0 242 F. Supp. 2d 752 (2002).\n\u00a0 Where insured alleged that insurer breached covenant of good faith and fair dealing by initiating action for declaratory judgment, insured would be unable to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that insurer's filing of lawsuit was based on an interpretation of disability insurance policy that was unreasonable; among other things, a reasonable jury could decide issue of fraud in insurer's favor based upon insured's failure to include 1990 surgery on insured's application for the policy.\u00a0 248 F. Supp. 2d 974 (2003).\n\u00a0 Insurance company did not breach the duty of good faith and fair dealing when it decided not to defend the operator of a concrete recycling plant or indemnify the owner where, inter alia, it appeared that plaintiffs did not disagree with insurance company's assertion that at a minimum, there was a genuine dispute as to whether coverage existed under the insurance policy.\u00a0 307 F. Supp. 2d 1170 (2004).\n\u00a0 Insurer's refusal to indemnify was not bad faith, where insurer denied coverage based on an unsettled question of law and, based on the court's ruling, was not ultimately obligated to indemnify insured; it was premature to ascertain whether insurer's refusal to defend was bad faith.\u00a0 504 F. Supp. 2d 998 (2007).\n\u00a0 Controlling date for the purpose of calculating the statute of limitations for plaintiff's claims of tortious breach of contract and bad faith denial of insurance benefits was two years after the last payment of motor vehicle insurance benefits; the date of plaintiff's receipt of payment, within three days of the date on which the payment was mailed, was the date on which the statute of limitations began to run.\u00a0 520 F. Supp. 2d 1212 (2007).\n\u00a0 Plaintiff's claim for bad faith denial of insurance benefits, which arose out of defendants' decision to seek arbitration, failed as a matter of law; any delay that was caused was reasonable in light of plaintiff's actions and did not amount to bad faith conduct.\u00a0 520 F. Supp. 2d 1212 (2007).\n\u00a0 Hawaii courts have not recognized the tort of bad faith outside the insurance context; however, even assuming a bad faith tort exists outside the insurance context, plaintiffs' tort claim for bad faith based upon a mortgage contract fails because plaintiffs' allegations concern pre-contract activities; moreover, even if plaintiffs are attempting to assert bad faith in the performance of a contractual right to foreclose, \"[t]he covenant [of good faith] does not 'impose any affirmative duty of moderation in the enforcement of legal rights'\".\u00a0 810 F. Supp. 2d 1125 (2011).\n\u00a0 It is well-settled that a defendant \"cannot breach the covenant of good faith and fair dealing before a contract is formed\"; accordingly, because plaintiff's allegations concerned pre-contract activities (failing to disclose terms, failing to conduct proper underwriting, making an improper loan to plaintiffs), defendants could not be liable for bad faith.\u00a0 814 F. Supp. 2d 1042 (2011).\n\u00a0 The tort of bad faith based upon a mortgage loan contract has not been recognized in Hawaii; moreover, although commercial contracts for \"sale of goods\" also contained an obligation of good faith in their performance and enforcement, this obligation did not create an independent cause of action.\u00a0 850 F. Supp. 2d 1120 (2012).\n\u00a0\u00a0Where the majority of the alleged failures to act in good faith dealt with past-loan consummation activities, even if Hawaii law did recognize such a claim, plaintiff cannot establish a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing with actions prior to contract formation. 907 F. Supp. 2d 1165 (2012).\n\u00a0 Bad faith cause of action may be brought by first-party insured for insurer misconduct.\u00a0 82 H. 120, 920 P.2d 334 (1996).\n\u00a0 Breach of implied contractual duties owed by workers' compensation insurer to employee, including duty to handle and pay claims in good faith, gives rise to independent tort cause of action by employee, the intended third-party beneficiary.\u00a0 83 H. 457, 927 P.2d 858 (1996).\n\u00a0 Where insured presented evidence that raised genuine issue of material fact as to insurer's liability for bad faith if insurer's law firm's conduct of defense breached law firm's duties towards insured and breach was causally induced by insurer's actions, summary judgment erroneously entered in favor of insurer on insured's bad faith claim. \u00a090 H. 39, 975 P.2d 1159 (1999).\n\u00a0 Any formal recognition of a claim for relief in favor of an injured claimant against a third-party tortfeasor's insurance company for bad faith settlement practices would require the assignment of the insured tortfeasor's rights arising from an underlying insurance contract to the injured plaintiff; the tort of bad faith settlement practices arises only from a contract of insurance.\u00a0 105 H. 112, 94 P.3d 667 (2004).\n\u00a0 Where there was no underlying insurance contract from which the duty of good faith settlement practices could arise, injured third-party claimant had no right to sue self-insured car rental company for bad faith.\u00a0 105 H. 112, 94 P.3d 667 (2004).\n\u00a0 Where insurer's denial of plaintiff's claim for no-fault benefits was based upon an open question of law--whether \"the reasons\" as used in \u00a7431:10C-304(3)(B) means \"all reasons\"--there was no bad faith on the part of insurer for not having stated all the reasons for its denial of plaintiff's claim.\u00a0 109 H. 537, 128 P.3d 850 (2006).\n\u00a0 Where plaintiff alleged that insurer handled the denial of plaintiff's claim for no-fault benefits in bad faith, plaintiff was not precluded from bringing bad faith claim even where there was no coverage liability on the underlying policy; thus, trial court erred in determining that, because plaintiff's breach of contract claim failed, plaintiff's bad faith claim must fail.\u00a0 109 H. 537, 128 P.3d 850 (2006).\n\u00a0 Where the question of whether the underinsured motorist benefits settlement from non-party insurer would trigger the two-year statute of limitations under \u00a7431:10C-315(a) (1993) for plaintiff's claim against defendant insurer was an open question of law until this case, there was no bad faith on the part of defendant insurer for having denied plaintiff's claim for no-fault benefits on the basis of the statute of limitations.\u00a0 109 H. 537, 128 P.3d 850 (2006).\n\u00a0 Appellate court erred in affirming trial court's grant of partial summary judgment on plaintiff's bad faith claim where there were genuine issues of material fact as to whether insurer breached its duty of good faith by: \u00a0(1) denying consent to settle on the ground that tortfeasor was financially secure; and (2) unreasonably interpreting its policy as requiring that the plaintiffs pursue tortfeasor to judgment as a precondition to receiving underinsured motorist coverage.\u00a0 118 H. 196, 187 P.3d 580 (2008).\n\u00a0 If a first-party insurer commits bad faith, an insured need not prove that the insured suffered economic or physical loss caused by the bad faith in order to recover emotional distress damages caused by the bad faith.\u00a0 126 H. 165, 268 P.3d 418 (2011).\n\u00a0 Petitioner, who was assigned by the state insurance joint underwriting program bureau to respondent under the assigned claim procedure, was owed a duty of good faith by respondent given that:\u00a0 (1) under the assigned claims procedure, respondent owed the same rights and obligations to petitioner as respondent would owe to an insured to whom respondent had issued a motor vehicle mandatory public liability and property insurance policy; and (2) respondent's good faith covenant implied in motor vehicle policies applied to claimants under the assigned claim procedure irrespective of the absence of a written insurance policy.\u00a0 129 H. 478, 304 P.3d 619 (2013).\n\u00a0 As action for bad faith against insurer is an independent tort, the proper limitation provision for bringing an action should not be that provided in the insurance policy, but rather that provided in \u00a7657-7, which limits causes of action for torts to two years.\u00a0 88 H. 442 (App.), 967 P.2d 639 (1998).\n\u00a0 Where insured's bad faith claim was not \"any issue referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing\" under \u00a7658-5, and action for bad faith in the first-party insurance context is independent of the policy, an ongoing appraisal process did not bar insured from bringing a lawsuit alleging bad faith handling of insured's claim.\u00a0 88 H. 442 (App.), 967 P.2d 639 (1998).\n\u00a0 Where claimant failed to make a counteroffer or attempt to engage in meaningful settlement discussions with workers' compensation insurer regarding insurer's offer before suing insurer for bad faith refusal to settle, failure was fatal to claimant's bad faith claim as it left claimant with nothing more than speculation to support claimant's allegations.\u00a0 112 H. 195 (App.), 145 P.3d 738 (2006).\n\u00a0 Where workers' compensation insurer's settlement offer simply stated that the amount offered \"would be for closure of your entire workers' compensation claim\", offer could not reasonably be interpreted as requiring workers' compensation claimant to release insurer from tort liability.\u00a0 112 H. 195 (App.), 145 P.3d 738 (2006).\n\u00a0 In the context of the Hawaii workers' compensation scheme, a physician is an incidental beneficiary rather than an intended third-party beneficiary of the employer's workers' compensation insurance policy; thus, as physician was not an intended third-party beneficiary of insurer's insurance policy, physician did not have a cause of action in tort for bad faith against insurer.\u00a0 114 H. 122 (App.), 157 P.3d 561 (2007).\n\u00a0\nCausation.\n\u00a0 Motion to dismiss count of plaintiffs' third amended complaint alleging that the design, manufacture, and/or production of subject chemicals by certain defendants constituted an ultrahazardous activity granted; the complaint was devoid of any allegation that plaintiffs' claimed injuries flowed directly from the act of manufacturing the subject chemicals, nor could plaintiffs make such causation allegations.\u00a0 293 F. Supp. 2d 1140 (2002).\n\u00a0 Defendant's motion for summary judgment denied in part where a genuine issue of material fact existed regarding whether or not defendant company's tofu caused plaintiff's immediate illness; no evidence that plaintiff ate anything else other than the tofu; reasonable to infer that eating the tofu caused plaintiff to become ill due to the immediate reaction plaintiff had from eating the tofu; medical testimony is not necessary to support the inference that tofu caused these symptoms where an individual has eaten only tofu and then suffers an upset stomach and diarrhea.\u00a0 819 F. Supp. 2d 1132 (2011).\n\u00a0 Defendant's motion for summary judgment granted in part where plaintiff failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact that any of plaintiff's injuries beyond plaintiff's immediate upset stomach and diarrhea were caused by eating defendant company's tofu; medical testimony is necessary to support plaintiff's allegations that the tofu caused plaintiff later alleged injuries beyond plaintiff's diarrhea and immediate sickness.\u00a0 819 F.

whether an implied easement exists depends on the parties' intent and was a question of fact for the jury.\u00a0 103 H. 385, 83 P.3d 100 (2004).\n\u00a0 While the fact that the privately owned road was platted on a subdivision map, that \u00a7265A-1 authorized counties to repair and maintain private streets, and \u00a746-16 authorized counties to regulate traffic on private streets, and each of these factors was significant in determining which party or parties had control of the private roadway, appellate court erred in concluding as a matter of law that defendant property owners did not control roadway and thus had no duty to maintain, repair, or warn of a dangerous condition; the issue of control of the roadway was a question of fact for the jury.\u00a0 103 H. 385, 83 P.3d 100 (2004).\n\u00a0 Under Act 190, L 1996, the State is required to warn of \"extremely dangerous\" ocean conditions (1) that occur at \"public beach parks\", (2) if these conditions are typical for the specific beach, and (3) if they present a risk of serious injury or death; as the Ke\u0091anae Landing area was not a public beach park, the State, as the owner and occupier of Ke\u0091anae Landing and its surrounding ocean water, did not have a duty to warn of any \"extremely dangerous\" ocean conditions at Ke\u0091anae Landing.\u00a0 109 H. 198, 124 P.3d 943 (2005).\n\u00a0 Where Act 190, L 1996, imposed no duty upon the State to warn of dangerous natural ocean conditions at \"beach accesses, coastal accesses, or in areas that are not public beach parks\", trial court correctly concluded that Act 190 relieved the State of any duty to warn plaintiffs of any dangerous ocean conditions at the Ke\u0091anae Landing area.\u00a0 109 H. 198, 124 P.3d 943 (2005).\n\u00a0 County did not have a duty to warn plaintiff of any dangers associated with diving in Queen's Bath, an ocean tide pool, and did not voluntarily assume a duty to warn by virtue of its signs pertaining to hazardous ocean and trail conditions; any duty that county may have had towards plaintiff because of the signs did not give rise to liability to plaintiff. \u00a0110 H. 189, 130 P.3d 1054 (2006).\n\u00a0 Even if Queen's Bath is deemed a \"de facto\" beach park, no liability on the part of the State or county arose because: \u00a0(1) the dangers found in Queen's Bath are natural conditions, which do not trigger a duty to warn on the part of the State and county; and (2) the provision of L 1996, Act 190, expressly exempt the State and county from liability for failing to warn of dangerous natural conditions.\u00a0 110 H. 189, 130 P.3d 1054 (2006).\n\u00a0 Inasmuch as the issue of foreseeability in the context of duty was a question of law for the court to resolve, the court, not the trier of fact, had to determine the existence and scope of duty, if any, owed by defendant to plaintiffs.\u00a0 112 H. 3, 143 P.3d 1205 (2006).\n\u00a0 Where evidence clearly established that the risk or hazard of the buried cement bag being propelled in the air during a future excavation was not what made the failure to remove the cement bag and to comply with the contract specifications by defendant unreasonably dangerous, defendant's general duty to use reasonable care did not include within its scope the protection of plaintiff from the particular risk that plaintiff encountered; thus, trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to defendant.\u00a0 112 H. 3, 143 P.3d 1205 (2006).\n\u00a0 Where, after construction of the highway was completed, there were complaints of water creating a potentially dangerous condition, the State then had a duty to maintain the highway in a reasonably safe condition, which included the duty to mitigate and warn of known hazards; the State breached this duty and trial court erred in finding that the State's breach of duty was not a substantial factor in causing plaintiff's death.\u00a0 113 H. 332, 152 P.3d 504 (2007).\n\u00a0 Where plaintiff's attorney did not owe defendants an actionable duty, trial court did not err in dismissing defendants' third-party claim against attorney alleging negligent handling of a settlement between attorney's client and defendants resulting in damage to defendants.\u00a0 114 H. 202, 159 P.3d 814 (2007).\n\u00a0 Based upon statutory and regulatory mandates, the legislature created a duty flowing to children specifically identified to the department of human services as being the subject of suspected abuse; thus, the department had a duty to protect the minor under the circumstances of the case.\u00a0 117 H. 262, 178 P.3d 538 (2008).\n\u00a0 In child abuse case, based upon the credible testimony of child protective services expert, and undisputed findings of fact relating to department of human services social worker's failure to properly and timely complete investigation into minor's injury, trial court correctly concluded that the department--through its social worker--breached the duty to use the same degree of care, skill, and ability as an ordinarily careful professional in the social worker's field would have exercised under similar circumstances.\u00a0 117 H. 262, 178 P.3d 538 (2008).\n\u00a0 Where plaintiffs did not assert any constitutional violations, their claims were grounded in common law principles of negligence, and the case did not involve involuntary commitment or custodial care, trial court erred to the extent that it believed that the Youngberg professional judgment standard applied to case involving the department of human services' improper investigation and failure to protect abuse victim from future harm.\u00a0 117 H. 262, 178 P.3d 538 (2008).\n\u00a0 Appellate court erred in concluding that defendant title insurance company did not have a duty to defend plaintiffs against the State's escheat claim in the specific, unique circumstances of the case where the State's escheat reservation contained in its answer and answer to amended petition qualified as an \"escheat claim\" which asserted an interest in and claims against the plaintiffs' property that triggered coverage under the plaintiffs' title insurance policy.\u00a0 126 H. 448, 272 P.3d 1215 (2012).\n\u00a0 Pursuant to \u00a7314A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, as a possessor of land who held its land open to the public, respondent mall owner owed members of the public who entered the mall in response to its invitation a duty to take reasonable action to give first aid after it knew or had reason to know that such persons were ill or injured, and to care for such persons until they could be cared for by others.\u00a0 130 H. 262, 308 P.3d 891 (2013).\n\u00a0 Pursuant to \u00a7388 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, and as adopted by the Hawaii supreme court, as a possessor of land in immediate control of the heat, smoke, and gases emanating from stoves in the food court into the exhaust duct, and knowing of decedent's (who somehow accessed the rooftop of respondent mall owner's mall, entered into and became trapped in an exhaust duct above the food court, and later died) presence in dangerous proximity to those forces, respondent had a duty to exercise reasonable care to control those forces to prevent them from doing harm to decedent.\u00a0 130 H. 262, 308 P.3d 891 (2013).\n\u00a0 By providing large amounts of hard liquor to a fifteen-year-old minor, defendant knew or should have known that defendant created an unreasonable risk of harm to the minor and thus assumed the duty to prevent the harm from occurring.\u00a0 Having failed to prevent physical harm from occurring, and in fact having caused the harm, defendant had the duty to prevent further harm from occurring.\u00a0 Thus, while defendant otherwise would have no duty to protect minor from physical harm, defendant's affirmative acts of providing alcohol and failing to render or summon aid after minor became visibly ill while on defendant's property and at defendant's party placed defendant into a relationship with minor in which defendant owed minor a duty of reasonable care.\u00a0 130 H. 282, 308 P.3d 911 (2013).\n\u00a0 Because of the obvious danger to young children, it was unreasonable to require that swimming pool manufacturer furnish labels with its pools warning of that danger; swimming pool manufacturer's duty to put a safe product on the market includes duty to take such measures in manufacturing and marketing the pool as will reasonably protect against injury to young children arising from their use of the pool.\u00a0 10 H.

Supp. 1365 (1995).\n\u00a0 Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that their claim for tortious interference with contract had any factual basis.\u00a0 920 F. Supp. 1080 (1996).\n\u00a0 Plaintiff's claim for tortious interference with contractual relations and business (containing separate torts of tortious interference with contractual relations and tortious interference with a prospective business advantage) failed as a matter of law.\u00a0 190 F. Supp. 2d 1192 (2001).\n\u00a0 Plaintiff's claim for damages resulting from defendants' allegedly tortious interference with plaintiff's contractual relations with its customers was preempted, where any determination of the applicability of state tort law would require consideration of the scope of various provisions of the collective bargaining agreement between plaintiff and defendant union; even if the claim were not preempted, it would still be dismissed.\u00a0 250 F. Supp. 2d 1244 (2003).\n\u00a0 Summary judgment denied, where there was a genuine issue of material fact as to each of the factors of intentional interference and proper justification of the tortious interference with prospective contractual relations claim.\u00a0 458 F. Supp. 2d 1153 (2006).\n\u00a0 Defendant's motion to dismiss count of complaint alleging tortious interference with a prospective economic advantage denied, where plaintiffs sufficiently alleged the \"improper interference\" element of the tort.\u00a0 679 F. Supp. 2d 1203 (2009).\n\u00a0 No interference with prospective business advantage where plaintiff, due to plaintiff's own failure to properly execute two options independently, caused plaintiff's investor contracts to fail and resulted in plaintiff's loss of financing; defendants' motion for summary judgment regarding this issue granted.\u00a0 710 F. Supp. 2d 1036 (2010).\n\u00a0 No interference with prospective contractual relations where plaintiff, due to plaintiff's own failure to properly execute two options independently, caused plaintiff's investor contracts to fail and resulted in plaintiff's loss of financing; defendants' motion for summary judgment regarding this issue granted.\u00a0 710 F. Supp. 2d 1036 (2010).\n\u00a0 By alleging an induced breach of a confidentiality agreement or a non-disclosure agreement, plaintiff has also alleged that defendants improperly acquired trade secret information; these claims are sufficiently related to plaintiff's allegations of trade secret misappropriation to warrant preemption of plaintiff's tortious interference with existing contracts claim under the Hawaii Uniform Trade Secrets Act; defendants' motion to dismiss granted.\u00a0 780 F. Supp. 2d 1061 (2011).\n\u00a0 Plaintiff resort employees' claim of tortious interference with prospective business advantage was not preempted by \u00a7301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7185(a) where defendant resort's use of the collective bargaining agreement (agreement) between defendant and plaintiffs did not render the claim dependent on the agreement, and furthermore where there was no argument set forth by plaintiffs that interpretation as opposed to mere consultation of the agreement would be necessary.\u00a0 818 F. Supp. 2d 1240 (2010).\n\u00a0 Plaintiff hotel employees' intentional interference with contractual and/or advantageous business relationships claim was not preempted by \u00a7301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7185(a) because the claim was independent of any right conferred by the collective bargaining agreement (agreement); agreement did not confer or deny plaintiffs the right to maintain business relations with customers; and there was no indication that any interpretation of the terms or provisions of the agreement was necessary to support or defend against this claim.\u00a0 835 F. Supp. 2d 914 (2011).\n\u00a0 Plaintiffs' intentional interference with prospective economic advantage claims dismissed; among other things, the amended complaint failed to allege a sufficiently definite prospective economic benefit, such as the rental or sale of plaintiffs' properties, prior to defendant's allegedly interfering conduct.\u00a0 1 F. Supp. 3d 1106 (2014).\n\u00a0 Where defendants-appellants brought interference with contract claim against plaintiff-appellee, there was no evidence that plaintiff-appellee intentionally induced [third party] to breach agreement with defendants-appellants, and defendants-appellants failed to prove damages resulting from the alleged breach.\u00a0 78 H. 40, 890 P.2d 277 (1995).\n\u00a0 Hawaii law does not recognize tortious breach of contract actions in the employment context.\u00a0 89 H. 234, 971 P.2d 707 (1999).\n\u00a0 Tort recovery, including recovery of punitive damages, is not allowed under Hawaii law for breach of contract in the absence of conduct that: \u00a0(1) violates a duty that is independently recognized by principles of tort law; and (2) transcends the breach of the contract.\u00a0 89 H. 234, 971 P.2d 707 (1999).\n\u00a0 Conspiracy to commit tortious interference with prospective business advantage between certain \"common purpose\" defendant corporations and also officer/shareholder of those corporations; claim failed for insufficient evidence.\u00a0 91 H. 224, 982 P.2d 853 (1999).\n\u00a0 Tortious interference with prospective business advantage recognized; elements.\u00a0 91 H. 224, 982 P.2d 853 (1999).\n\u00a0 Where complaint asserted that an actual, ongoing prospective economic relationship existed between the physician-plaintiff/members and their patients; members expected a reasonable future economic benefit from that relationship; by requiring members to enter into participating physician agreements, defendant was aware or should have been reasonably aware of their expectancy of a future economic benefit; defendant maliciously and intentionally disrupted their relationships with their patients by delaying, denying, and\u00a0 reducing reimbursement; and such disruption imposed serious financial hardships upon the members, thereby causing damage.\u00a0 Plaintiffs satisfied the rudimentary pleading requirement for their claims of tortious interference with prospective economic advantage.\u00a0 113 H. 77, 148 P.3d 1179 (2006).\n\u00a0 In complaints alleging intentional interference with contractual relations and prospective economic advantage, tortious inducement of breach of fiduciary duty and tortious interference with contractual relations, where there were no allegations that indicated that lawyers \"possessed a desire to harm which is independent of the desire to protect their clients\", and the complaints were devoid of any allegations that the lawyers \"acted for personal gain or with ill-will towards\" plaintiffs, lawyers' management of the inspection and review process of plaintiff's books and records fell within the purview of the litigation privilege.\u00a0 113 H. 251, 151 P.3d 732 (2007).\n\u00a0 Plaintiffs established the elements of their claim of tortious interference with prospective business advantage, including the existence of damages, where defendants banned plaintiffs from working at certain city-owned facilities.\u00a0 131 H. 167, 317 P.3d 1 (2013).\n\u00a0 A plaintiff alleging the tort of interference with prospective contractual relations must plead and prove six elements.\u00a0 87 H. 394 (App.), 957 P.2d 1076 (1998).\n\u00a0 Under circumstances of case, defendant's communication of information to prospective employer's manager was privileged because it was truthful; thus, defendant could not be held liable as a matter of law for any alleged intentional interference with plaintiff's prospective employment contract with prospective employer.\u00a0 87 H. 394 (App.), 957 P.2d 1076 (1998).\n\u00a0 Where loan broker did not present evidence showing that bank pursued an improper objective of harming broker or used wrongful means that caused injury in fact, trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of bank on broker's tortious interference with prospective business advantage claim.\u00a0 109 H. 35 (App.), 122 P.3d 1133 (2005).\n\u00a0 Without evidence of an act of intentional inducement, loan broker had no basis for its claim that bank tortiously interfered with broker's contractual relationship with borrower; evidence merely of a breached contract was insufficient to sustain a tortious interference with contractual relations claim; thus, trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of bank on broker's tortious interference with contractual relations claim.\u00a0 109 H. 35 (App.), 122 P.3d 1133 (2005).\n\u00a0\nLandowner.\n\u00a0 Plaintiffs' claim for nuisance denied, where parties in the lawsuit owned neighboring oceanfront lots in a luxury subdivision and plaintiffs alleged that defendants' use of property created an unreasonable and substantial interference with plaintiffs' use and enjoyment of their lot and was thereby a nuisance.\u00a0 338 F. Supp. 2d 1106 (2004).\n\u00a0 Where plaintiff was seriously injured while attending an expo at a hotel when a registration booth fell on plaintiff, there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the defendant that owned and operated the hotel, should have known that the booth was susceptible to being blown over by the strong winds.\u00a0 634 F.

lessor not liable under Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7358, where plaintiffs failed to adduce any facts demonstrating that lessees or sublessees did not know or have reason to know track's lighting was dangerously inadequate.\u00a0 76 H. 77, 869 P.2d 216 (1994).\n\u00a0 Chapter 520, the Hawaii recreational use statute, was not intended to have created a universal defense available to a commercial establishment such as landowner hotel, which has opened its land to the public for commercial gain, against any and all liability for personal injury merely because there is a \"recreational\" component to the establishment's operation.\u00a0 93 H. 477, 6 P.3d 349 (2000).\n\u00a0 Plaintiffs, by averring in their affidavits that they were on landowner's land for a commercial purpose at the time plaintiff was injured, generated a genuine issue of material fact whether they were on the land for a commercial purpose, in which case this chapter would not immunize the landowner from liability, or whether they were present for an exclusively recreational purpose, in which case this chapter would be available to landowner as a defense to plaintiff's negligence claim.\u00a0 93 H. 477, 6 P.3d 349 (2000).\n\u00a0 Under Act 190, L 1996, the State is required to warn of \"extremely dangerous\" ocean conditions (1) that occur at \"public beach parks\", (2) if these conditions are typical for the specific beach, and (3) if they present a risk of serious injury or death; as the Ke\u0091anae Landing area was not a public beach park, the State, as the owner and occupier of Ke\u0091anae Landing and its surrounding ocean water, did not have a duty to warn of any \"extremely dangerous\" ocean conditions at Ke\u0091anae Landing.\u00a0 109 H. 198, 124 P.3d 943 (2005).\n\u00a0 Where Act 190, L 1996, imposed no duty upon the State to warn of dangerous natural ocean conditions at \"beach accesses, coastal accesses, or in areas that are not public beach parks\", trial court correctly concluded that Act 190 relieved the State of any duty to warn plaintiffs of any dangerous ocean conditions at the Ke\u0091anae Landing area.\u00a0 109 H. 198, 124 P.3d 943 (2005).\n\u00a0 Pursuant to \u00a7314A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, as a possessor of land who held its land open to the public, respondent mall owner owed members of the public who entered the mall in response to its invitation a duty to take reasonable action to give first aid after it knew or had reason to know that such persons were ill or injured, and to care for such persons until they could be cared for by others.\u00a0 130 H. 262, 308 P.3d 891 (2013).\n\u00a0 Pursuant to \u00a7388 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, and as adopted by the Hawaii supreme court, as a possessor of land in immediate control of the heat, smoke, and gases emanating from stoves in the food court into the exhaust duct, and knowing of decedent's (who somehow accessed the rooftop of respondent mall owner's mall, entered into and became trapped in an exhaust duct above the food court, and later died) presence in dangerous proximity to those forces, respondent had a duty to exercise reasonable care to control those forces to prevent them from doing harm to decedent.\u00a0 130 H. 262, 308 P.3d 891 (2013).\n\u00a0\u00a0Summary judgment was properly granted on petitioner decedent's estate general premises liability claim against respondent mall owner as a possessor of land because respondent owed no duty to a person not reasonably anticipated to be on the mall's rooftop and, based on the admissible evidence, decedent could not have reasonably been anticipated to be on the rooftop.\u00a0 Further, even if respondent should have reasonably anticipated decedent's presence on the rooftop, it could not have been held liable because decedent's entry into the exhaust vent, where decedent became trapped and later died, was not reasonably foreseeable.\u00a0 130 H. 262, 308 P.3d 891 (2013).\n\u00a0 To recover in negligence, it must be shown that owner or occupant of premises knew or should have known of the hazard causing the injuries.\u00a0 1 H. App. 554, 623 P.2d 446 (1981).\n\u00a0 Continuing-tort exception, which tolls running of statute of limitations under \u00a7662-4, adopted; thus, where an actor continuously diverts water over which he or she has direct control onto another's land, and the diversion causes continuous and substantial damage to that person's property and the actor knows of this damage, such an act may present evidence of a continuous tort.\u00a0 88 H. 241 (App.), 965 P.2d 783 (1998).\n\u00a0\nMalicious prosecution.\n\u00a0 Summary judgment granted in favor of defendants on plaintiff's malicious prosecution claim, where defendant police officer and defendant resident manager had probable cause to arrest plaintiff for harassment.\u00a0 855 F. Supp. 1167 (1994).\n\u00a0 Defendants' motion for summary judgment denied in malicious prosecution action, where there was a question of fact as to whether the underlying civil actions were terminated in plaintiff's favor when the actions were voluntarily dismissed with prejudice.\u00a0 150 F. Supp. 2d 1058 (2001).\n\u00a0 Where plaintiff alleged that defendants were liable for malicious prosecution for deliberately providing false information to police to cause plaintiff's arrest, defendants' motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim denied with regard to the claim.\u00a0 475 F.

Supp. 2d 1249 (2000).\n\u00a0 Hospital's motion for summary judgment on issue of informed consent granted, where plaintiffs argued, inter alia, that because hospital provided doctors with consent forms (which bore hospital's name) and had an institutional policy regarding informed consent, hospital injected itself in consent process, thereby becoming subject to liability.\u00a0 125 F. Supp. 2d 1249 (2000).\n\u00a0 Liability of a hospital for allegedly negligent acts of its independent contractor doctors, discussed.\u00a0 125 F.

Supp. 2d 1249 (2000).\n\u00a0 Where there was no express attorney-client contract formed between plaintiff and defendant, there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether an attorney-client relationship existed regarding the drafting of the prenuptial agreement.\u00a0 522 F. Supp. 2d 1272 (2007).\n\u00a0 Manufacturer's package insert, in and of itself, may not establish the relevant standard of care in a medical negligence action.\u00a0 78 H. 287, 893 P.2d 138 (1995).\n\u00a0 The question of part (b) causation in an action based on doctrine of informed consent is to be judged by an objective standard, that is, whether a reasonable person in plaintiff-patient's position would have consented to the treatment that led to his or her injuries had plaintiff-patient been properly informed of the risk of the injury that befell him or her.\u00a0 79 H. 362, 903 P.2d 667 (1995).\n\u00a0 A consulting physician does not owe a duty to a patient to warn of the inherent risks of a proposed treatment or surgery; however, a physician tendering a second opinion has an obligation to inform a patient of the nature of the proposed treatment or surgery, its risks, and alternatives.\u00a0 87 H. 183, 953 P.2d 561 (1998).\n\u00a0 Court erred in holding that plaintiff was required to prove by expert testimony that a dentist owes a duty to disclose the risks or potential complications of surgery.\u00a0 87 H. 183, 953 P.2d 561 (1998).\n\u00a0 Where physician retained degree of participation in treatment, by way of control, consultation and otherwise, physician had continuing responsibility to properly advise patient of the risks and alternatives to the proposed surgery.\u00a0 87 H. 183, 953 P.2d 561 (1998).\n\u00a0 Where the relationship between an attorney and a non-client is such that a duty of care would be recognized, the non-client may proceed under either negligence or contract theories of recovery.\u00a0 95 H. 247, 21 P.3d 452 (2001).\n\u00a0 Where defendant doctor never properly established at trial the \"therapeutic privilege exception\" to the requirement that informed consent be obtained before starting patient on antipsychotic medication, trial court erred in refusing to instruct jury concerning the tort of negligent failure to provide informed consent.\u00a0 98 H. 470, 50 P.3d 946 (2002).\n\u00a0 The collateral source rule prohibits reducing a plaintiff's award of medical special damages to reflect the discounted amount paid by medicare/medicaid; the amounts billed in excess of the medicare/medicaid amount paid are not irrelevant or inadmissible on the issue of medical special damages.\u00a0 106 H. 81, 101 P.3d 1149 (2004).\n\u00a0 Attorney representing a client may be personally liable to an adverse party or a third person as a result of attorney's intentional tortious act.\u00a0 1 H. App. 379, 620 P.2d 733 (1980).\n\u00a0 Evidence fell short of providing the causal nexus between any alleged negligence of defendants and patient's death where there was no expert medical testimony that negligence by defendants caused patient's death \"to a reasonable medical probability\", leaving the jury to speculate that defendants' \"action or inaction might or could have\" resulted in patient's death seventeen months later.\u00a0 119 H. 136 (App.), 194 P.3d 1098 (2008).\n\u00a0 Where the causal link between any alleged negligence and patient's death seventeen months after the surgeries was not within the realm of \"common knowledge\", and the role that preexisting conditions and/or subsequent complications played in patient's death was not within the knowledge of the average layperson, patient sustained a \"sophisticated injury\", and a jury needed expert medical testimony to determine whether any alleged negligence by defendants contributed to patient's death; plaintiffs were thus required to present expert medical testimony on the causal link between any alleged negligence and patient's death.\u00a0 119 H. 136 (App.), 194 P.3d 1098 (2008).\n\u00a0 The circuit court did not err in finding that defendants, state-employed prison doctors, caused plaintiff inmate's infertility, where testimonies and medical reports of multiple expert witnesses provided substantial evidence in support of the court's findings of fact.\u00a0\u00a0 131 H. 239 (App.), 317 P.3d 683 (2013).\n\u00a0 The circuit court's findings that defendants, state-employed prison doctors, were negligent pertained to the exercise of purely medical discretion because they involved strictly medical diagnosis and treatment, and the decisions made did not involve policy making or any other type of governmental discretion; thus, defendants were not entitled to qualified immunity, and the court did not err when it denied their motion for summary judgment.\u00a0 131 H. 239 (App.), 317 P.3d 683 (2013).\n\u00a0 See 43 H. 289 (1959).\n\u00a0\nMaster and servant.\n\u00a0 Negligence claim against employer for failure to conduct adequate investigation of misconduct allegation against employee preempted by Labor Management Relations Act.\u00a0 817 F.

Supp. 1167 (1994).\n\u00a0 Defendant's motion for summary judgment granted with respect to plaintiff's claim for negligent training and supervision, where no evidence in the record to suggest that the assault on plaintiff was foreseeable to defendant.\u00a0 126 F. Supp. 2d 1299 (1998).\n\u00a0 Police officer was an independent contractor, not an employee of defendant that employed the officer as a special duty officer to direct traffic at defendant's construction site on date of incident; defendant could not be held liable under respondeat superior for torts committed by police officer while the officer was performing the officer's public duty as a police officer.\u00a0 126 F. Supp. 2d 1299 (1998).\n\u00a0 Exclusivity provision (\u00a7386-5) of the workers' compensation law barred plaintiff's negligence-based counts against defendants, where the counts arose \"on account\" of a work injury suffered by plaintiff; exception provided in exclusivity provision did not afford plaintiff a cause of action, where plaintiff did not allege sexual harassment or sexual assault.\u00a0 266 F. Supp. 2d 1233 (2003).\n\u00a0 Defendant city and county of Honolulu's motion to dismiss plaintiff's false arrest on respondeat superior grounds claim based on immunity denied where it was plausible to infer that, as alleged by plaintiff, the police officer who shot plaintiff with a taser without provocation, punched and kicked plaintiff, and arrested plaintiff, and the police officer who assisted the arresting officer, were acting with malice.\u00a0 761 F. Supp. 2d 1080 (2010).\n\u00a0 Defendant city and county of Honolulu's motion to dismiss plaintiff's negligent supervision claim granted where plaintiff failed to allege that the police officers who arrested plaintiff were acting outside the scope of their employment.\u00a0 761 F.

Supp. 3d 1043 (2014).\n\u00a0 Strict products liability--adoption of doctrine, proof of defect, parties in chain of distribution.\u00a0 52 H. 71, 470 P.2d 240 (1970).\n\u00a0 In strict products liability action, state-of-the-art evidence not admissible to establish whether seller knew or should have known of dangerousness of product.\u00a0 69 H. 287, 740 P.2d 548 (1987); 960 F.2d 806 (1992).\n\u00a0 Punitive damages may be awarded in products liability action based on underlying theory of strict liability where plaintiff proves requisite aggravating conduct on part of defendant.\u00a0 71 H. 1, 780 P.2d 566 (1989).\n\u00a0 Publication is not a \"product\".\u00a0 73 H. 359, 833 P.2d 70 (1992).\n\u00a0 To bring implied warranty of merchantability action for personal injury, plaintiff must show product unmerchantability sufficient to avoid summary judgment on issue of defectiveness in a tort strict products liability suit.\u00a0 74 H. 1, 837 P.2d 1273 (1992).\n\u00a0 Economic loss rule applies to bar recovery of pure economic loss in actions based on products liability but does not bar actions based on negligent misrepresentation or fraud.\u00a0 82 H. 32, 919 P.2d 294 (1996).\n\u00a0 Manufacturer not negligent in failing to warn of \"blind zone\" danger where danger involved in using straddle carrier was obvious and apparent, discernible by casual inspection, and generally known and recognized.\u00a0 85 H. 336, 944 P.2d 1279 (1997).\n\u00a0 Negligence and strict products liability claims against defendants for defective manufacture or design of fungicide not preempted by Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act.\u00a0 86 H. 214, 948 P.2d 1055 (1997).\n\u00a0 Where defendants voluntarily assumed express warranty on fungicide label, and though express warranty on label was EPA approved it was not mandated under Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, Act did not preempt plaintiffs' claims for breach of express warranty.\u00a0 86 H. 214, 948 P.2d 1055 (1997).\n\u00a0 As dangers of riding unrestrained in open cargo bed of pickup truck are obvious and generally known to ordinary user, truck manufacturer had no duty to warn potential passengers of those dangers.\u00a0 87 H. 413, 958 P.2d 535 (1998).\n\u00a0 Escalator was not a \"product\" for purposes of strict liability claim against department store where it was located, but was a \"product\" for purposes of strict liability claims against manufacturer and distributor.\u00a0 89 H. 204, 970 P.2d 972 (1998).\n\u00a0 Where jurors could conclude either that design of tire rim assembly was cause of tire repairman's death or repairman's own negligence was sole legal cause of death, trial court erred in granting summary judgment for tire manufacturer on issue of tire manufacturer's strict liability for defective design of tire rim assembly.\u00a0 92 H. 1, 986 P.2d 288 (1999).\n\u00a0 Where owner of road grader was itself a user and consumer of the wheel components, was not in the business of selling or leasing the tire rim assembly, and did not introduce the harmful product into the stream of commerce, it was not strictly liable for tire repairman's death and was not under a duty to warn of possible dangers associated with the wheel assembly.\u00a0 92 H. 1, 986 P.2d 288 (1999).\n\u00a0 It is not always necessary to produce the specific instrumentality causing the accident to prove a case in products liability.\u00a0 1 H.

Supp. 736 (1992).\n\u00a0 Plaintiffs' argument that since manufacturer improperly used defendant's trademark, and defendant failed to prevent this improper use, defendant was liable for alleged defective nature of implant, rejected.\u00a0 844 F.

Supp. 2d 1101 (2004).\n\u00a0 Count of plaintiff's complaint sounding in common law wrongful termination in violation of public policy failed to state a claim; there could be no statutorily-based Parnar common law claims where, as with the federal Pregnancy Discrimination and Family and Medical Leave Acts, the statutes themselves provided comprehensive remedial schemes to vindicate their public policies.\u00a0 324 F. Supp. 2d 1144 (2004).\n\u00a0 Plaintiffs' spoliation claims failed as a matter of law, where plaintiffs based their spoliation claims on the destruction of plants from the alleged Costa Rica field test; destruction of the plants did not result in plaintiffs' inability to prove the underlying cases.\u00a0 330 F. Supp. 2d 1101 (2004).\n\u00a0 Defendant, an outside auditor hired by pension plan trustees, was entitled to summary judgment as to plaintiff's negligence and negligent misrepresentation claims, where plaintiff was, at most, an incidental beneficiary of defendant's audit and plaintiff's reliance, if any, was not justified.\u00a0 433 F.

Supp. 2d 1190 (2007).\n\u00a0 Defendant's alleged tort claims for negligent fulfillment of the contract were thinly veiled contract claims, thus, insofar as defendant's tort claims were premised on third-party defendant's supposed failure to produce a design according to their contract, those claims were barred.\u00a0 591 F. Supp. 2d 1141 (2008).\n\u00a0 Plaintiff was seriously injured while attending an expo at a hotel when a registration booth fell on plaintiff.\u00a0 There appeared to be a genuine issue of material fact regarding plaintiffs' negligent design claim as to whether the danger of the booth toppling over because of a strong gust of wind was reasonably foreseeable.\u00a0 634 F.

Supp. 2d 1061 (2010).\n\u00a0 Plaintiff, who appeared to have sold its option to purchase property to an alleged buyer, sufficiently alleged a negligent misrepresentation claim; all elements of negligent misrepresentation met where plaintiff alleged that defendant supplied false information as a result of defendant's failure to exercise reasonable diligence in investigating the property, plaintiff was the person for whose benefit the information was supplied and as a result suffered a loss, and plaintiff relied on the misrepresentation.\u00a0 693 F. Supp. 2d 1192 (2010).\n\u00a0 Civil claim for conspiracy sufficient where, as alleged by plaintiff, all defendants had an agreement to further the alleged fraud, defendant falsely represented the costs of the loans, defendant hid the fact that there would be two loans, defendant misrepresented plaintiff's income on the loan documents, and defendant misstated the amount that plaintiff was required to pay.\u00a0 707 F. Supp. 2d 1080 (2010).\n\u00a0 Defendants' motion for summary judgment on conversion claim denied where there existed a genuine issue of material fact as to whether or not defendants possessed \"a constructive or actual intent to injure plaintiffs\"; dispute remained regarding whether or not defendants wrongfully detained escrow funds in bad faith and therefore would be liable to plaintiff.\u00a0 710 F. Supp. 2d 1036 (2010).\n\u00a0 No misrepresentation by defendant where plaintiff clearly failed to rely on the fact that plaintiff had a viable option due to plaintiff's failure to even attempt to exercise such an option; defendants' alleged misrepresentation did not affect plaintiff's actions; defendants' motion for summary judgment on this issue granted.\u00a0 710 F.

Supp. 2d 1061 (2011).\n\u00a0 Defendant lender's motion for summary judgment denied as to plaintiff borrower's aiding and abetting claim to the extent it relied on a theory that defendant lender breached its duties to plaintiff (by failing to properly complete the notice of right to cancel forms regarding the loan transactions and not disclosing the negative amortization in the first loan) and thus, provided \"substantial assistance\" to defendant mortgage broker or defendant escrow company, or both, in their alleged commission of chapter 480 violations or fraud.\u00a0 834 F.

Supp. 2d 1061 (2011).\n\u00a0 Defendant lender's motion for summary judgment granted on plaintiff borrower's conspiracy claim where plaintiff failed to establish an agreement or understanding between defendant lender and defendant mortgage broker; plaintiff only presented the representations made by defendant mortgage broker about the terms of loans it was offering to plaintiff and plaintiff's declaration of employee of mortgage broker's promise to use employee's connections with defendant lender to obtain financing.\u00a0 834 F. Supp. 2d 1061 (2011).\n\u00a0 Even assuming that defendant lender made false representations about the terms of loans it was offering to plaintiff borrower, the representations were merely promissory in nature or expressions of intentions; plaintiff could not recover on a fraud claim based on the failure to fulfill those promises unless plaintiff could prove that, when defendant made those representations, it did not have the present intent to fulfill them; defendant's motion for summary judgment on plaintiff's fraud claim granted.\u00a0 834 F.

Supp. 2d 1035 (2013).\n\u00a0 Defendant's motion to dismiss as to wrongful discharge in violation of public policy claim granted; among other things, plaintiff's allegations, taken as true, showed that plaintiff abandoned plaintiff's job.\u00a0 945 F.

court thus erred in granting summary judgment in favor of dealership on the basis that plaintiffs' damages were inadequate.\u00a0 98 H. 309, 47 P.3d 1222 (2002).\n\u00a0 The three to five dollars plaintiffs claimed having spent on gasoline responding to car dealership's advertisement, if proved, satisfied the requirement of \"substantial pecuniary loss\" necessary to support a claim for relief grounded in fraud.\u00a0 98 H. 309, 47 P.3d 1222 (2002).\n\u00a0 State employees' retirement system board has a fiduciary duty to provide its members with clear, understandable information concerning retirement benefits;
