Supp. 778 (1993).\n\u00a0 Limitations period in section applied, where defendants argued that plaintiff's wrongful death action was derivative of the claims of the estate and therefore barred by applicable statutes of limitation; statute of limitations governing plaintiff's claim should begin to run when plaintiff experienced plaintiff's injury, not when plaintiff's husband knew of husband's injury.\u00a0 854 F.

Supp. 2d 898 (2010).\n\u00a0 Section 657-20 is limited to causes of action mentioned in part I of chapter 657 or this section, and therefore does not apply to plaintiff's claim brought pursuant to chapter 480.\u00a0 777 F.
