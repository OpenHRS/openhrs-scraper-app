[L 1957, c 312, pt of \u00a71; Supp, \u00a7245A-4; HRS \u00a7662-4; am L 1976, c 219, \u00a716]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Claim accrues when the plaintiff knew or should have known that an actionable wrong has been committed.\u00a0 63 H. 117, 621 P.2d 957 (1980).\n\u00a0 Minority tolling not applicable.\u00a0 72 H. 77, 806 P.2d 957 (1991).\n\u00a0 Plaintiff's lack of knowledge regarding a legal duty, the breach of which may have caused plaintiff's injury, did not justify application of \"discovery rule\"; plaintiff's failure to seek legal advice from an attorney did not toll statute of limitations.\u00a0 81 H. 391, 917 P.2d 718 (1996).\n\u00a0 Counties do not fall within the ambit of the State Tort Liability Act; \u00a746-72 is the statute of limitations applicable to actions against the counties.\u00a0 104 H. 341, 90 P.3d 233 (2004).\n\u00a0 Where plaintiffs' claim did not accrue until the quantum of the medical care they actually received exceeded the medical-rehabilitative limit set forth in \u00a7431:10C-306(b)(2) (1993), and plaintiff apparently exceeded that limit, this section afforded plaintiffs two years from the accrual of their claim within which to file their lawsuit; as plaintiffs' claim had accrued by the time they filed their complaint but not more than two years prior, the complaint was timely under this section; thus, trial court properly denied defendant's motion to dismiss.\u00a0 113 H. 459, 153 P.3d 1144 (2007).\n\u00a0 Where \u00a746-72 (2006) created a class of tort claimants, injured by the conduct of a county, who were subject to a six-month statute of limitations period for filing their complaint, and victims of injuries caused by the State under this section had a two-year limitation period, and there was no rational basis to support such disparate treatment, \u00a746-72 (2006) was unconstitutional under article I, \u00a75 of the Hawaii constitution.\u00a0 115 H. 1, 165 P.3d 247 (2007).\n\u00a0 Continuing-tort exception, which tolls running of statute of limitations under this section, adopted; thus, where an actor continuously diverts water over which he or she has direct control onto another's land, and the diversion causes continuous and substantial damage to that person's property and the actor knows of this damage, such an act may present evidence of a continuous tort.\u00a0 88 H. 241 (App.), 965 P.2d 783 (1998)."
