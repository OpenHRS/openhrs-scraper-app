[L 1957, c 312, pt of \u00a71; Supp, \u00a7245A-2; HRS \u00a7662-2; am L 1972, c 164, \u00a72(a)]\n\u00a0\nAttorney General Opinions\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 State liable for torts of volunteers working for state agencies.\u00a0 Att. Gen. Op. 85-8.\n\u00a0\nLaw Journals and Reviews\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Punitive Damages in Hawaii:\u00a0 Curbing Unwarranted Expansion.\u00a0 13 UH L. Rev. 659 (1991).\n\u00a0 Fido Seeks Full Membership In The Family:\u00a0 Dismantling The Property Classification of Companion Animals By Statute.\u00a0 25 UH L. Rev. 481 (2003).\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Consent to suit in federal court; waiver of immunity in this section is not just a waiver to actions in state courts.\u00a0 512 F. Supp. 889 (1981).\n\u00a0 Where plaintiffs argued that State waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity through the enactment of \u00a7353-14 and the State's Tort Claims Act [sic], this section and \u00a7663-1, no express consent or applicable waiver provisions found.\u00a0 940 F. Supp. 1523 (1996).\n\u00a0 Section 661-1 and this section did not constitute a waiver of defendants' Eleventh Amendment immunity where plaintiffs contended that defendants' failure to provide sufficient Hawaiian language in Hawaii's public schools violated state and federal laws.\u00a0 951 F. Supp. 1484 (1996).\n\u00a0 State must exercise same standard of care required of private party.\u00a0 51 H. 150, 454 P.2d 112 (1969).\n\u00a0 Prohibition against payment of interest \"prior to judgment\" construed.\u00a0 52 H. 156, 472 P.2d 509 (1970).\n\u00a0 State's duty to construct and maintain safe highways; no obligation to guard against unusual accidents.\u00a0 57 H. 405, 557 P.2d 125 (1976).\n\u00a0 Negligent operation of automobile by escapee of state hospital held not a foreseeable consequence of the negligence which permitted the escape.\u00a0 59 H. 515, 583 P.2d 980 (1978).\n\u00a0 Assumption of risk is applicable for failure to provide a safe working place only in cases of voluntary employment and does not apply to prison laborers.\u00a0 The State owes a duty to protect prisoners from unreasonable risk of physical harm.\u00a0 60 H. 557, 592 P.2d 820 (1979).\n\u00a0 This act did not waive sovereign immunity from suits for money damages for constitutional rights.\u00a0 61 H. 369, 604 P.2d 1198 (1979).\n\u00a0 Duty owed by State to public school students during required attendance entails general supervision unless specific needs or dangerous situation require specific supervision.\u00a0 62 H. 483, 616 P.2d 1376 (1980).\n\u00a0 Negligent infliction of mental distress.\u00a0 Death of family dog.\u00a0 63 H. 557, 632 P.2d 1066 (1981).\n\u00a0 Reconstruction or replacement of Moanalua stream bridge would involve evaluation of broad policy factors, and therefore was discretionary function.\u00a0 66 H. 76, 655 P.2d 877 (1982).\n\u00a0 Based on State's knowledge of defective guardrail, danger it posed to a driver and passengers who struck it, and the opportunity to improve it, trial court did not err in concluding that State breached its duty of care in failing to design, construct, and/or maintain--which includes a duty to \"correct\" defects in--the highway and guardrail.\u00a0 91 H. 60, 979 P.2d 1086 (1999).\n\u00a0 Where prior accident gave State reasonable prior notice of a prior occurrence under similar circumstances, State had made improvements to highway in vicinity of guardrail, and had knowledge of potential ramping problems associated with guardrail, intoxicated driver's reckless actions were \"reasonably foreseeable\" and thus not the sole legal cause of plaintiff's injuries and damages.\u00a0 91 H. 60, 979 P.2d 1086 (1999).\n\u00a0 This section provides in clear and unambiguous language that the State shall not be liable for interest prior to judgment and constitutes a plain reservation of immunity with respect to prejudgment interest on judgments rendered against the State.\u00a0 As no other statute unequivocally expresses a clear relinquishment of the State's immunity from awards of prejudgment interest, trial court did not err in concluding that the State is immune from paying prejudgment interest on the damages for which it is liable.\u00a0 105 H. 104, 94 P.3d 659 (2004).\n\u00a0 Where, assuming that the department of human services had a legal duty to protect minor, as plaintiffs alleged that it did, a \"special relation\" would exist between the department and the minor such that the department's duty would encompass a duty to prevent further physical harm to minor upon reports of physical abuse; thus, where plaintiffs met their burden of demonstrating the existence of a private analog in the form of a \"special relationship\" that satisfied the necessary elements under Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7315(b), plaintiffs met the threshold requirement of a claim against the department.\u00a0 117 H. 262, 178 P.3d 538 (2008).\n\u00a0 Read together, \u00a7662-5 acts as a limitation on the general state tort liability waiver found in this section, and the general waiver thus does not provide a right to a jury trial for tort actions against state entities; therefore, the circuit court did not err in independently determining the state hospital's liability, resulting in joint and several damages different from those \"awarded\" by the jury.\u00a0 127 H. 325 (App.), 278 P.3d 382 (2012)."
