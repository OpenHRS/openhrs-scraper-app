Gen. Op. 63-36.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Six-year limitations period for contracts was considered adequate time for union trust fund to bring action against employer.\u00a0 823 F.2d 289 (1987).\n\u00a0 Paragraph (1)'s six-year limitation period applied to employer's claim for breach of duty of loyalty.\u00a0 338 F.3d 1082 (2003).\n\u00a0 Applicable limitations period for actions brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a71983.\u00a0 574 F. Supp. 1510 (1983); 749 F.2d 588 (1984).\n\u00a0 Six-year statute of limitations governs federal securities fraud claims brought pursuant to Rule 10b-5 of the Rules and Regulations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and claims brought under Hawaii's civil RICO statute.\u00a0 758 F. Supp. 1357 (1991).\n\u00a0 Statute of limitations in \u00a7294-36 [\u00a7431:10C-315's predecessor] applied to underinsured motorist benefits claim, where defendant asserted that appropriate statute of limitations was the statute of limitations applicable to contract actions under this section.\u00a0 847 F. Supp. 787 (1994).\n\u00a0 Where defendant contended that claim for breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing was barred by two-year statute of limitations governing damage to persons and property (\u00a7657-7), since there is no element in the cause of action for bad faith that requires a plaintiff to suffer personal injury, it is not in reality a cause of action based upon a \"personal injury\", and the applicable statute of limitations is six years and is found in the catchall provision of this section (\u00a7657-1(4)).\u00a0 986 F. Supp. 1334 (1997).\n\u00a0 Magistrate's finding that paragraph (1) did not bar defendant's breach of contract counterclaim due to its relation back under federal rules of civil procedure rule 15(c) not clearly erroneous.\u00a0 217 F. Supp. 2d 1077 (2001).\n\u00a0 Count of complaint alleging breach of contract under the second alleged agreement was barred by the statute of limitations; plaintiffs had constructive knowledge of their cause of action arising out of the second alleged agreement no later than 1996 and the doctrine of constructive notice applied despite any fiduciary relationship that may have existed.\u00a0 Portions of the counts sounding in fraud that related to the second alleged agreement were barred by the statute of limitations.\u00a0 360 F. Supp. 2d 1122 (2005).\n\u00a0 Some of plaintiff's claims for additional minimum rent and percentage rent were time-barred by paragraph (1), where the court found that under Hawaii law, a cause of action for rent accrues upon the due date of each rental payment.\u00a0 515 F. Supp. 2d 1141 (2007).\n\u00a0 Whether the appropriate analogous statute of limitations in actions for attorney's fees under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act was \u00a7657-7 or paragraph (4), discussed.\u00a0 621 F. Supp. 2d 1013 (2008).\n\u00a0 Doctrine of anticipatory repudiation did not apply to the statute of limitations on plaintiff insured's breach of contract claim where plaintiff claimed that plaintiff fully performed under the life insurance policy and defendant insurers' time for performance had not yet arrived; consequently, plaintiff could not bring an action for breach of contract because it was untimely and, thus, defendant's motion for summary judgment was granted.\u00a0 792 F. Supp. 2d 1111 (2011).\n\u00a0 Plaintiff insured's breach of contract claim time-barred where the claim was brought over twenty-five years after defendant insurers' demands for additional payments and over ten years after defendants confirmed to plaintiff that plaintiff's life insurance policy was terminated; defendants' motion for summary judgment on this issue granted.\u00a0 792 F. Supp. 2d 1111 (2011).\n\u00a0 Plaintiff's claims sounding in fraud were subject to a six-year statute of limitations.\u00a0 992 F. Supp. 2d 1053 (2014).\n\u00a0 Plaintiff was charged with constructive knowledge of the contents of the deed on the date it was recorded; because plaintiff's complaint was filed more than six years after the recording of the allegedly forged deed, plaintiff's claims sounding in fraud were barred by the applicable statute of limitations.\u00a0 992 F. Supp. 2d 1053 (2014).\n\u00a0 Claims for legal malpractice governed by paragraph (1). 55 H. 167, 517 P.2d 1 (1973).\n\u00a0 Claim based on express warranty is in contract and is governed by clause (1); breach of express warranty occurs when.\u00a0 63 H. 210, 626 P.2d 173 (1981).\n\u00a0 Claim based on fraudulent representations or negligent representations is governed by clause (4).\u00a0 63 H. 210, 620 P.2d 173 (1981).\n\u00a0 Not applicable limitations period for arbitration of disputes under no-fault policy.\u00a0 68 H. 117, 706 P.2d 16 (1985).\n\u00a0 Section inapplicable to action seeking enforcement of promissory note which had merged into divorce decree.\u00a0 73 H. 566, 836 P.2d 1081 (1992).\n\u00a0 Two-year statute of limitations of \u00a7657-7 governs actions brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a71983 rather than six-year catchall limitations period of paragraph (4).\u00a0 73 H. 578, 837 P.2d 1247 (1992).\n\u00a0 Where fraudulent misrepresentation action was governed by general limitations period of six years under paragraph (4) and complaint was filed six years four months after death of person making alleged misrepresentation, summary judgment properly granted.\u00a0 86 H. 21, 946 P.2d 1317 (1997).\n\u00a0 The statute of limitations in a legal malpractice claim is governed by paragraph (1), the accrual of which is determined by application of the discovery rule.\u00a0 95 H. 247, 21 P.3d 452 (2001).\n\u00a0 Claims against sovereign.\u00a0 Statute does not run on claim against sovereign who cannot be sued.\u00a0 3 H. 483 (1873).\u00a0 When suit permitted against sovereign must be brought within time limited. 11 H. 404 (1898).\n\u00a0 Exceptions.\u00a0 Statute does not run between death of intestate and appointment of administrator.\u00a0 3 H. 367 (1872); see 3 H. 483 (1873). Although statute has run, equity may decree repayment.\u00a0 4 H. 593 (1882).\u00a0 Continuing express trust in personalty not within the statute.\u00a0 5 H. 497 (1885).\u00a0 Claims of Territory for taxes not barred. 21 H. 597 (1913); 18 H. 252 (1907).\u00a0 Statute tolled by disability of infancy, when.\u00a0 20 H. 170 (1910).\u00a0 This section does not apply to injuries to land.\u00a0 20 H. 237 (1910).\u00a0 Statute does not begin to run against district court judgment pending judgment on appeal.\u00a0 20 H. 370 (1911).
