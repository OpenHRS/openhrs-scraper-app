[L 1973, c 92, \u00a71; am L 1976, c 219, \u00a717; am L 1977, c 167, \u00a714; gen ch 1985; am L Sp 1986, c 2, \u00a715; am L 2010, c 4, \u00a79]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\nClaims against doctors were not barred by the statute of limitations; the statute of limitations defense was waived at the time the claims were removed from the medical claim conciliation panel.\u00a0 299 F. Supp. 2d 1131 (2003).\n\u00a0 Statute of limitations begins to run the moment person discovers or should have discovered the negligent act, the damage, and the causal connection.\u00a0 65 H. 84, 648 P.2d 689 (1982).\n\u00a0 Distinguished from \"general\" personal injury statute of limitations of \u00a7657-7.\u00a0 73 H. 578, 837 P.2d 1247 (1992).\n\u00a0 An expert opinion validating the legal basis for a claim is not required in order to trigger running of statute of limitations under this section; section also does not require the procurement of a favorable expert opinion before a cause of action accrues.\u00a0 89 H. 244, 971 P.2d 717 (1999).\n\u00a0 For a cause of action to accrue and the statute of limitations to commence under this section, legal knowledge of defendant's negligence is not required; thus, plaintiff's cause of action accrued when plaintiff had discovered that stroke was caused by defendant's inadequate administration of medication.\u00a0 89 H. 244, 971 P.2d 717 (1999).\n\u00a0 The two-year limitation begins to run when plaintiff discovers or should have discovered the damage, the violation of the duty, and the connection between the violation of the duty and the damage.\u00a0 1 H. App. 519, 622 P.2d 613 (1981).\n\u00a0 Where questions of whether plaintiff should have, using reasonable diligence, discovered the negligence more than two years before filing suit, and whether plaintiff relied on actions by defendants in not pursuing plaintiff's claim were in dispute and thus were matters for the trier of fact to decide, trial court erred in granting summary judgment for defendants.\u00a0 112 H. 336 (App.), 145 P.3d 879 (2006)."
