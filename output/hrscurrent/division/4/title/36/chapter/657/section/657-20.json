[CC 1859, \u00a71049; RL 1925, \u00a72654; RL 1935, \u00a73925; RL 1945, \u00a710436; RL 1955, \u00a7241-19; HRS \u00a7657-20; am L 1972, c 105, \u00a71(1)]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Possibility that plaintiffs can show \"lulling\" or fraudulent concealment is sufficient to avoid summary disposition on statute of limitations defense.\u00a0 501 F. Supp. 830 (1980).\n\u00a0 Applicability of statute of limitations to state securities fraud claims discussed.\u00a0 758 F. Supp. 1357 (1991).\n\u00a0 Where plaintiffs claimed that fraudulent concealment tolled the statute of limitations applicable to their contract claims:\u00a0 (1) material questions of fact existed regarding the breach of the first alleged agreement; and (2) the count alleging breach of contract under the second alleged agreement was barred by the statute of limitations; plaintiffs had constructive knowledge of their cause of action arising out of the second alleged agreement no later than 1996 and the doctrine of constructive notice applied despite any fiduciary relationship that may have existed.\u00a0 360 F. Supp. 2d 1122 (2005).\n\u00a0 Doctrine of fraudulent concealment was inapplicable, where plaintiffs had not brought forth evidence sufficient to support a finding that defendant's employees took affirmative steps to conceal anything.\u00a0 396 F. Supp. 2d 1150 (2005).\n\u00a0 This section is limited to causes of action mentioned in part I of chapter 657 or \u00a7663-3, and therefore does not apply to plaintiff's claim brought pursuant to chapter 480.\u00a0 777 F. Supp. 2d 1224 (2011).\n\u00a0 Plaintiff did not set forth any facts to support a plausible allegation of fraudulent concealment, where plaintiff did not point to conduct by either defendant to conceal anything, including the existence of plaintiff's current causes of action, and failed to allege any acts by defendants to prevent plaintiff from suing in time.\u00a0 Also, the alleged facts that plaintiff contended were concealed were evident on the face of the recorded trustee deed.\u00a0 992 F. Supp. 2d 1053 (2014).\n\u00a0 Construed in connection with contention that nondisclosure amounts to concealment.\u00a0 44 H. 297, 353 P.2d 820 (1960).\n\u00a0 Nature of fraudulent concealment.\u00a0 63 H. 210, 626 P.2d 173 (1981).\n\u00a0 Discussed:\u00a0 792 F. Supp. 2d 1111 (2011)."
