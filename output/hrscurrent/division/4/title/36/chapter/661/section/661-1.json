Supp. 95 (1975).\n\u00a0 No defense of sovereign immunity, including Eleventh Amendment, can be raised as to actions under this chapter if the applicable consent section is \u00a7661-11.\u00a0 512 F. Supp. 889 (1981).\n\u00a0 This section and \u00a7662-2 did not constitute a waiver of defendants' Eleventh Amendment immunity where plaintiffs contended that defendants' failure to provide sufficient Hawaiian language in Hawaii's public schools violated state and federal laws.\u00a0 951 F. Supp. 1484 (1996).\n\u00a0 Nothing in the language of this section and \u00a7662-3 suggests that Hawaii intended to subject itself to suit in federal court.\u00a0 950 F. Supp. 2d 1159 (2013).\n\u00a0 Public officer making government contracts, not personally liable.\u00a0 2 H. 433 (1861); 5 H. 383 (1885).\n\u00a0 Suit by way of mandamus against state officer to do what a statute requires of officer is not a suit against the State.\u00a0 7 H. 470 (1888).\u00a0 Suit against Commissioner of Public Lands to rescind lease made with another not suit against the State.\u00a0 40 H. 675, 686 (1955).\u00a0 Suit for recovery of money illegally exacted and already paid over is suit against State.\u00a0 11 H. 10 (1897).\u00a0 See \u00a740-35.\n\u00a0 Where salary has been paid to de facto officer acting under color of title, de jure officer cannot recover from government salary of office while he was out of same.\u00a0 9 H. 311 (1893).\n\u00a0 Hawaiian government not liable for conversion of private fund by one of its employees acting outside scope of his official duties.\u00a0 10 H. 607 (1897).\n\u00a0 Government consenting to be sued may do so upon such terms and conditions as it pleases.\u00a0 11 H. 10 (1897).\n\u00a0 Statute not unconstitutional on ground that jury is denied.\u00a0 11 H. 10 (1897).\u00a0 Nor on ground that it is retrospective.\u00a0 11 H. 404 (1898).\u00a0 See 11 H. 566 (1898); 13 H. 465 (1901); 17 H. 285 (1906), rev'd 206 U.S. 206 (1907).\n\u00a0 State not liable for injuries from defective streets.\u00a0 13 H. 478 (1901) (prior to enactment of chapter 662).\u00a0 Ejectment does not lie against government.\u00a0 13 H. 1 (1900).\u00a0 Partition does not lie when State claims absolute title.\u00a0 48 H. 92, 395 P.2d 620 (1964).\u00a0 State cannot be made party to suit to foreclose mortgage.\u00a0 17 H. 82 (1905), aff'd 205 U.S. 349 (1907).\u00a0 State not liable for extras except in accordance with contract.\u00a0 16 H. 711 (1905).\u00a0 See 27 H. 792 (1924).\n\u00a0 Waiver by statute. \u00a033 H. 379 (1935); 33 H. 409 (1935); 34 H. 213 (1937).\n\u00a0 Implied contract.\u00a0 36 H. 75 (1942); 43 H. 28 (1958) (prior to enactment of chapter 662).\n\u00a0 Suit against government agency in private capacity as trustee. 37 H. 8 (1944).\n\u00a0 Claim under \u00a7101-27 may not be made subject of collateral suit against State under this section.\u00a0 49 H. 365, 369-370, 418 P.2d 482 (1966).\n\u00a0 Proceeding against property in which State has an interest is suit against State and cannot be maintained without consent of State.\u00a0 50 H. 207, 436 P.2d 527 (1968); 49 H. 365, 418 P.2d 482 (1966); 51 H. 87, 451 P.2d 809 (1969).\n\u00a0 Implied contract for State to pay taxpayer earnings on protested, paid tax.\u00a0 56 H. 655, 547 P.2d 581 (1976).\n\u00a0 Sovereign immunity held to preclude suit against State based on chapter 480.\u00a0 60 H. 228, 588 P.2d 430 (1978).\n\u00a0 Where plaintiffs seek injunction for unconstitutional acts and damages, sovereign immunity bars suit.\u00a0 68 H. 192, 708 P.2d 129 (1985), cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1169 (1986).\n\u00a0 An order denying a pretrial motion based on sovereign immunity is not a final judgment, therefore, not appealable.\u00a0 71 H. 519, 795 P.2d 283 (1990).\n\u00a0 Further waiver of sovereign immunity not necessary for \u00a7607-14 to apply to the State and its agencies in matters in which, by virtue of the express waiver of sovereign immunity set forth in this section, the State has become a party.\u00a0 87 H. 37, 951 P.2d 487 (1998).\n\u00a0 Insofar as the State has not expressly and statutorily waived its sovereign immunity from postjudgment interest in suits brought pursuant to this section, the State is immune from awards of \u00a7478-3 postjudgment interest in actions under this section; thus, the trial court erred in ordering that the employees' retirement system pay statutory interest at the rate of ten per cent per annum, pursuant to \u00a7478-3.\u00a0 106 H. 416, 106 P.3d 339 (2005).\n\u00a0 Where ocean recreation management area permit at issue was a revocable license rather than a contract, this section was not a basis for subject matter jurisdiction.\u00a0 113 H. 184, 150 P.3d 833 (2006).\n\u00a0 Where \u00a7343-7 waived the State's sovereign immunity against actions brought to challenge: (1) the lack of an environmental assessment; (2) the determination that an environmental impact statement is or is not required; and (3) the acceptance of an environmental impact statement, sovereign immunity did not prevent the application of the private attorney general doctrine against the State and the circuit court did not err in relying on the doctrine as a basis for its award of attorney's fees against the State and Superferry jointly.\u00a0 120 H. 181, 202 P.3d 1226 (2009).\n\u00a0 Plaintiffs had to demonstrate a waiver of sovereign immunity specifically over attorneys' fees because plaintiffs did not implicate this section (case did not arise under this section) or any statutory waiver of sovereign immunity; rather plaintiffs' case involved claims for declaratory and injunctive relief based on alleged constitutional violations by defendant State and state officials.\u00a0 130 H. 162, 307 P.3d 142 (2013).\n\u00a0 Does not confer jurisdiction on insurer actions to recover moneys paid to the State without protest under \u00a7431-318.\u00a0 5 H. App. 122, 678 P.2d 1104 (1984).\n\u00a0 Suit authorized as one based on implied contract of warranty of authority.\u00a0 5 H. App. 616, 705 P.2d 72 (1985).\n\u00a0 Suit to recover public assistance benefits wrongfully denied is a claim against State founded upon any statute.\u00a0 6 H. App. 160, 715 P.2d 813 (1986).\n\u00a0 As the doctrine of primary jurisdiction applies to claims against the employees' retirement system arising out of alleged miscalculation of retirement contribution and benefits, while the circuit court had original jurisdiction over the claim, the court did not abuse its discretion in staying, rather than dismissing, the class action pending administrative review of plaintiffs' individual claims.\u00a0 121 H. 462 (App.), 220 P.3d 1043 (2009).\n\u00a0 While the accrual and extent of an employee's benefits are governed by the applicable statutory provisions of chapter 88, the duty of the employees' retirement system to pay accrued benefits is deemed to be contractual under article XVI, \u00a72 of the Hawaii constitution; thus, a circuit court's jurisdiction under paragraph (1) over such claims is \"founded upon contract\", as well as statute and the circuit court did not err in rejecting defendant's contention that plaintiffs' claims were barred by sovereign immunity.\u00a0 121 H. 462 (App.), 220 P.3d 1043 (2009).\n\u00a0 As this section contains a limited waiver of sovereign immunity for claims against the State that are founded upon a statute or founded upon a contract with the State, the circuit court did not err when it allowed plaintiff substitute teachers to pursue breach-of-contract claims against the State where the teachers were in a contractual relationship with the State, sought money that they claimed were due them for the work they performed under the contract, and alleged that under the express and implied terms of their agreement, they were entitled to pay in accordance with \u00a7302A-624(e).\u00a0 122 H. 150 (App.), 223 P.3d 215 (2009).\n\u00a0 The State's sovereign immunity from plaintiff substitute teachers' claims against the State was waived under this section and \u00a7302A-624(e) where \u00a7302A-624(e) stated that the per diem salary for substitute teachers \"shall be\" based on the formula that it described, and \u00a7302A-624(e), as a pay-mandating statute, provided an alternative basis for invoking the court's jurisdiction under the \"founded upon any statute\" language in this section.\u00a0 122 H. 150 (App.), 223 P.3d 215 (2009)."
