take steps to prevent a foreclosure as soon as you are having trouble paying your mortgage.\u00a0 You should contact your lender or your lender's loan servicer, or you may contact a budget and credit counselor or housing counselor, to discuss your situation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 STEP ONE:\u00a0 NOTICE OF DEFAULT.\u00a0 The first step in the foreclosure process is the Mortgagee usually sends you a written notice of default, which occurs after you are past due on your mortgage payment.\u00a0 The Mortgagee will tell you in the notice how much time you have to pay the required amount that is past due and, by paying, will return your loan to good standing.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 STEP TWO:\u00a0 PROCEEDING TO FORECLOSURE.\u00a0 If you do not pay the required amount past due by the deadline in the notice of default, the Mortgagee may elect to proceed to collect the balance due on your loan through foreclosure.\u00a0 In Hawaii, there are two types of foreclosures:\u00a0 judicial and nonjudicial.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In a JUDICIAL FORECLOSURE, the Mortgagee files a lawsuit against you in order to obtain a court judgment that you owe the balance due under your loan and to obtain an order to sell the property.\u00a0 The initial legal document you will receive in the lawsuit is called the complaint.\u00a0 You should consult an attorney of your choice who can advise you as to the steps needed to protect your rights.\u00a0 Judicial foreclosure involves the sale of the mortgaged property under the supervision of the court.\u00a0 You will receive notice of the foreclosure case hearings and the sale date and the judicial decision is announced after a hearing in court.\u00a0 The sale of the property must be approved by the court before it can be completed.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In a NONJUDICIAL FORECLOSURE, the process follows the procedures spelled out in Chapter 667 of the Hawaii Revised Statutes and in your mortgage.\u00a0 The nonjudicial procedures allow a Mortgagee to foreclose on and sell the property identified in the mortgage without filing a lawsuit or court supervision.\u00a0 This nonjudicial foreclosure is also called a power of sale foreclosure.\u00a0 The Mortgagee starts the process by giving you a written notice of default and of the Mortgagee's intent to sell the property.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After the required time has elapsed, you will be sent a notice of nonjudicial foreclosure sale, which will tell you the date and location of the sale.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In a NONJUDICIAL FORECLOSURE, if you own an interest in the property you may have the right to participate in the Mortgage Foreclosure Dispute Resolution Program or to convert the nonjudicial foreclosure into a judicial foreclosure.\u00a0 The nonjudicial foreclosure may not proceed during the dispute resolution process or after it has been converted to a judicial foreclosure.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PLEASE NOTE:\u00a0 Even if a judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure has commenced, you may be able to reinstate the loan and keep your home if you pay the delinquent amount then due and the foreclosure expenses that your Mortgagee has incurred.\u00a0 You must contact the Mortgagee as soon as possible to determine whether reinstatement is possible.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 STEP THREE:\u00a0 PUBLIC SALE.\u00a0 The sale of a foreclosed home is usually made through a public auction, where the highest bidder who can make a cash deposit of up to 10% of the bid can buy the property.\u00a0 In a judicial foreclosure, the court appoints a third party commissioner to advertise and conduct the sale.\u00a0 In a nonjudicial foreclosure, the Mortgagee advertises and conducts the sale.\u00a0 In both types of sales, the Mortgagee has the right to buy the property by submitting a credit bid based upon the balance owed on the mortgage, so long as its bid is higher than any other bids.\u00a0 If the Mortgagee buys the property, the Mortgagee has the right to re-sell it in a private sale at a later date.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 STEP FOUR:\u00a0 DISBURSEMENT OF PROCEEDS; POTENTIAL DEFICIENCY JUDGMENT.\u00a0 After the foreclosure sale is completed, the proceeds are paid out to lien holders, including the Mortgagee, in the order set by law and lastly to you if there are any proceeds left.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In a JUDICIAL FORECLOSURE, the court tells the commissioner whom to pay and how much.\u00a0 If the property did not sell for enough to pay off the balance due under your loan, the Mortgagee has the right to ask the court for a deficiency judgment against you for the difference.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In a NONJUDICIAL FORECLOSURE, the Mortgagee distributes the proceeds from the sale.\u00a0 If you are an owner-occupant, the law prohibits a deficiency judgment against you unless the debt is secured by other collateral.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 READ THE NOTE AND MORTGAGE CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS REQUIRED AND HOW TO AVOID FORECLOSURE, AND CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY REGARDING YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS.\"\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (c)\u00a0 The requirements of this section shall apply only to written loan applications submitted, or to loans where residential property is required to be used as security, after August 31, 2012.
