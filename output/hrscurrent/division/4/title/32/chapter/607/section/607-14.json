Supp. 474 (1964); 5 H. App. 174, 683 P.2d 883 (1984).\n\u00a0 This section applicable where plaintiff sued on insurance policy under clause of policy permitting suit by one recovering judgment against insured.\u00a0 255 F. Supp. 710 (1966).\n\u00a0 Court did not have jurisdiction and therefore could not reach whether defendants were \"prevailing parties\" for purposes of this section.\u00a0 679 F. Supp. 2d 1220 (2010).\n\u00a0 Because defendant obtained judgment in the action, the twenty-five per cent limitation on attorneys' fees should be based upon the amount sued for, i.e., the value of the loan amount.\u00a0 933 F. Supp. 2d 1264 (2013).\n\u00a0 In order to be deemed the prevailing party for purposes of this section, defendant must have obtained final judgment in its favor.\u00a0 Insofar as the court entered final judgment in defendant's favor, there could be no dispute that defendant was the prevailing party.\u00a0 933 F. Supp. 2d 1264 (2013).\n\u00a0 Where two of the five claims in the complaint were in the nature of assumpsit, the court could not practicably apportion between the assumpsit and non-assumpsit claims because the claims were inextricably intertwined.\u00a0 Moreover, the hours expended in the action and motions practice were not directed at any specific claims.\u00a0 933 F. Supp. 2d 1264 (2013).\n\u00a0 Necessity for final determination of cause.\u00a0 12 H. 348 (1900) (summons or service quashed); 19 H. 258 (1908) (dismissal for failure to give security for costs); 21 H. 408 (1913) (nonsuit for failure of proof);

40 H. 92 (1953).\n\u00a0 Where an appeal judgment for appellee is vacated and case remanded for new trial, appellee not entitled to attorney's fees.\u00a0 62 H. 34, 609 P.2d 137 (1980).\n\u00a0 Claim was in the nature of assumpsit.\u00a0 67 H. 433, 690 P.2d 279 (1984).\n\u00a0 Where there is a specific contractual provision for attorney's fees, \u00a7607-17 should be applied.\u00a0 72 H. 4, 803 P.2d 199 (1990).\n\u00a0 Section inapplicable where claim sounds in tort rather than assumpsit.\u00a0 74 H. 1, 837 P.2d 1273 (1992).\n\u00a0 Appellants entitled to award of reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in bringing appeal on the action for breach of the covenant against encumbrances. 76 H. 396, 879 P.2d 501 (1994).\n\u00a0 Supreme court has jurisdiction to award reasonable attorneys' fees incurred on appeal, and supreme court may do so if requirements of HRAP rule 39(d) and this section are met; decisions about fees incurred at trial level more properly within trial court's discretion.\u00a0 76 H. 396, 879 P.2d 501 (1994).\n\u00a0 Where plaintiff's claim for specific enforcement of agreement was not action in assumpsit, trial court's denial of plaintiff's request for attorney's fees against defendant proper.\u00a0 85 H. 19, 936 P.2d 655 (1997).\n\u00a0 Under this section, an action in the nature of assumpsit does not need a clause in writing providing for attorneys' fees in order for attorneys' fees to be granted.\u00a0 86 H. 21, 946 P.2d 1317 (1997).\n\u00a0 Under this section, attorneys' fees may be awarded in three types of cases:\u00a0 all actions in the nature of assumpsit; all actions on a promissory note; and contracts in writing that provide for an attorney's fee.\u00a0 86 H. 21, 946 P.2d 1317 (1997).\n\u00a0 Further waiver of sovereign immunity not necessary for this section to apply to the State and its agencies in matters in which, by virtue of the express waiver of sovereign immunity set forth in \u00a7661-1, the State has become a party.\u00a0 87 H. 37, 951 P.2d 487 (1998).\n\u00a0 Where Oregon law firm did not \"practice law within the jurisdiction\" of Hawaii, it did not violate \u00a7605-14 nor \u00a7605-17; thus plaintiff could recover fees under this section for services rendered by firm.\u00a0 87 H. 37, 951 P.2d 487 (1998).\n\u00a0 Where plaintiffs prevailed \"on the disputed main issue\", they were entitled to recoup all of their litigation expenses pursuant to this section.\u00a0 87 H. 37, 951 P.2d 487 (1998).\n\u00a0 As this section does not expressly or obviously manifest an intent to be applied retroactively, the 1993 amendment does not apply retroactively to litigation terminated prior to the effective date of the amendment, July 1, 1993.\u00a0 88 H. 46, 961 P.2d 611 (1998).\n\u00a0 Proper cap on the maximum amount of attorneys' fees that can be awarded as a result of circuit court action where final judgment was entered in 1992 is that found in the statute in effect in 1992; this statutory cap is the maximum total amount that can be awarded, not an amount that can be awarded to each prevailing party.\u00a0 88 H. 46, 961 P.2d 611 (1998).\n\u00a0 Where the maximum possible judgment is capable of determination, it should serve as a limit on the amount of the defendant's attorney's fees pursuant to this section.\u00a0 88 H. 115, 962 P.2d 374 (1998).\n\u00a0 Where reduction of the attorneys' fees requested was supported by the record, trial court's reduction of fees without explanation was not abuse of discretion.\u00a0 90 H. 25, 975 P.2d 1145 (1998).\n\u00a0 Award of attorneys' fees for defendant erroneous where plaintiff's claims against defendant stemmed primarily from allegations of fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, and statutory violations, not breach of contract.\u00a0 92 H. 243, 990 P.2d 713 (1999).\n\u00a0 Where purchaser prevailed on its claim to the contract deposit and successfully defended against plaintiff's specific performance/breach claim, purchaser, \"on balance\", was the prevailing party on the issues in the case and was thus entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees under this section.\u00a0 92 H. 482, 993 P.2d 516 (2000).\n\u00a0\u00a0Plaintiff not entitled to attorneys' fees pursuant to this section for plaintiff's appeal as an appeal is not a distinct \"action\" but a continuation of the original action and plaintiff's underlying action in the trial court sounded in tort and not assumpsit.\u00a0 93 H. 1, 994 P.2d 1047 (2000).\n\u00a0 A defendant who succeeds in obtaining a judgment of dismissal is a prevailing party for the purposes of fees under this section.\u00a0 96 H. 327, 31 P.3d 184 (2001).\n\u00a0 In appropriate cases, a request or award of attorneys' fees may include compensation for separately billed legal services performed by a paralegal, legal assistant, or law clerk; the reasonableness of legal assistant fees must be reviewed on a case by case basis for the value of services rendered and an award of such fees must be limited to charges for work performed that would otherwise have been required to be performed by a licensed attorney at a higher rate.\u00a0 96 H. 327, 31 P.3d 184 (2001).\n\u00a0 As proceedings under \u00a7431:15-323 are not in the nature of assumpsit, trial court did not err in denying insurance commissioner attorneys' fees under this section in suit against customer of liquidated mutual benefit society.\u00a0 99 H. 53, 52 P.3d 823 (2002).\n\u00a0 Section applies only to court actions and not arbitration proceedings; thus, section does not affect disputes submitted in arbitration.\u00a0 102 H. 210, 74 P.3d 33 (2003).\n\u00a0 The plain language of this section does not require a judgment on the merits; a dismissal of plaintiff's action, albeit voluntary, was sufficient to deem a defendant to be the prevailing party and the plaintiff the losing party; thus defendant was the \"prevailing party\" and plaintiff was the \"losing party\" for the purpose of awarding attorneys' fees pursuant to this section.\u00a0 103 H. 26, 79 P.3d 119 (2003).\n\u00a0 Trial court erred in awarding attorneys' fees to insurer pursuant to this section as this section does not provide for attorneys' fees in declaratory judgment actions; relief sought by insured and insurer was a declaration as to the applicability of insurance coverage for insured's injuries, not money damages, and was thus not in the nature of assumpsit.\u00a0 103 H. 263, 81 P.3d 1178 (2003).\n\u00a0 Where record on appeal did not reflect whether the trial court apportioned fees between assumpsit and non-assumpsit claims, appellate court could not effectively review whether trial court abused its discretion in awarding attorneys' fees as it did; thus, case vacated and remanded for redetermination.\u00a0 107 H. 106, 111 P.3d 1 (2005).\n\u00a0 Where allowing insurer to seek attorney's fees under this section would have contravened the attorney's fee award scheme set forth in \u00a7431:10C-211, trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying insurer's motion for attorney's fees and costs.\u00a0 109 H. 537, 128 P.3d 850 (2006).\n\u00a0 Where underlying appeal involved an adjudication of rights in which no monetary liability was in issue, the twenty-five per cent limitation was inapplicable to the case.\u00a0 110 H. 217, 131 P.3d 500 (2006).\n\u00a0 Where plaintiff's allegations were that engineering firm's and State's negligent failure to protect plaintiff from \"dangerous and/or defective conditions\" legally caused plaintiff's injuries, plaintiff's claims sounded in tort, not assumpsit; thus, plaintiff was not entitled to attorney's fees under this section.\u00a0 110 H. 269, 132 P.3d 378 (2006).\n\u00a0 Plaintiff entitled to attorneys' fees under this section where plaintiff successfully defended claim of breach of contract; trial court did not abuse discretion in awarding attorneys' fees where amount was well within twenty-five per cent of the judgment, was well-documented, and trial judge had personal knowledge of the complexity of the litigation and the nature and quality of the legal services rendered before it.\u00a0 111 H. 286, 141 P.3d 459 (2006).\n\u00a0 Trial court did not abuse discretion in denying defendants' motion for attorneys' fees under this section where lien application was brought pursuant to the mechanic's lien statute, \u00a7507-47, and, as such, was not a common law action, and the action was for the attachment of a mechanic's lien to the subject property, not for damages based upon the underlying contract; thus, the action was not in the nature of assumpsit.\u00a0 111 H. 349, 141 P.3d 996 (2006).\n\u00a0 Where plaintiffs' claims for relief did not involve monetary damages based upon the non-performance of a contractual agreement for legal services between defendants and hotel operator, but primarily requested a declaration and injunction, the \"essential character\" of the action was not in the nature of assumpsit; thus, trial court abused its discretion in granting attorneys' fees to defendants.\u00a0 113 H. 251, 151 P.3d 732 (2007).\n\u00a0 Where homeowner association was a nonprofit organization and the covenants in its first declaration ran with the land, it was a \"planned community association\" for purposes of this section; thus, association was not subject to the twenty-five per cent cap on its attorneys' fees incurred on appeal.\u00a0 114 H. 361, 162 P.3d 1277 (2007).\n\u00a0 Based on the plain language of this section and, because the amount the jury awarded terminated attorney plaintiff differed from the amount sued for, the amount of attorneys' fees awarded varied when the prevailing party changed from plaintiff to defendant law firm; as law firm limited its fee request to its assumpsit claim, the calculation of which was dictated by this section, it was unnecessary for the trial court to apportion fees between assumpsit and non-assumpsit claims; and, as there was adequate documentation, trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting law firm's motion for attorneys' fees.\u00a0 117 H. 92, 176 P.3d 91 (2008).\n\u00a0 The plain language of \u00a7658A-21(b) and its related commentary from the Uniform Arbitration Act established that awards of attorneys' fees can be valid and authorized based on a party agreement, even if the resulting award exceeds the twenty-five per cent of the judgment limitation included in this section.\u00a0 123 H. 476, 236 P.3d 456 (2010).\n\u00a0 Section did not apply to plaintiff's suit for specific performance, but applied to defendant's counterclaim in the nature of assumpsit.\u00a0 2 H. App. 400, 633 P.2d 556 (1981).\n\u00a0 Under circumstances, attorney's fees should have been awarded in accordance with this section rather than \u00a7607-17.\u00a0 2 H. App. 551, 634 P.2d 1052 (1981).\n\u00a0 Action in the nature of reformation does not fall within scope of this section.\u00a0 3 H. App. 101, 641 P.2d 1361 (1982).\n\u00a0 Where contract fully performed, action on contract for sum certain is \"in the nature of assumpsit\".\u00a0 3 H. App. 624, 656 P.2d 1353 (1983).\n\u00a0 When calculating \"amount sued for\", life expectancy tables and present value of future benefits may be used.\u00a0 4 H. App. 455, 667 P.2d 844 (1983).\n\u00a0 Error to award fees based on punitive damages counterclaim.\u00a0 5 H. App. 174, 683 P.2d 833 (1984).\n\u00a0 Action to collect on judgment rendered in proceeding to confirm arbitrator's award not an assumpsit action.\u00a0 5 H. App. 315, 690 P.2d 1310 (1984).\n\u00a0 Under circumstances, attorney's fees should have been awarded in accordance with this section rather than \u00a7607-17.\u00a0 5 H. App. 581, 704 P.2d 930 (1985).\n\u00a0 Computation of fees on complaint and counterclaim; exclusion where fees based on duplicative claim.\u00a0 5 H. App. 603, 705 P.2d 67 (1985).\n\u00a0 In making attorney's fee awards under \u00a7666-14 and this section, the trial court must designate the specific amount awarded pursuant to each statute to prevent duplicative awards and permit effective appellate review of awards.\u00a0 85 H. 501 (App.), 946 P.2d 609 (1997).\n\u00a0 Landlord entitled to include partial rental payments received from tenant after landlord initiated suit as part of judgment for purpose of computing attorney's fees under this section.\u00a0 85 H. 501 (App.), 946 P.2d 609 (1997).\n\u00a0 Pursuant to this section, attorney's fees may be awarded under a sublease as a sublease is contractual in nature and this section authorizes such an award in all actions on \"contract[s] in writing that provides for an attorney's fee\".\u00a0 85 H. 501 (App.), 946 P.2d 609 (1997).\n\u00a0 The amount of the judgment upon which attorneys' fees are calculated under this section should include prejudgment interest.\u00a0 85 H. 501 (App.), 946 P.2d 609 (1997).\n\u00a0 Under \u00a7666-14, a landlord may, incident to a summary possession action, seek attorney's fees attributable to the summary possession action which are in addition to, but not duplicative of, any fees awarded under this section.\u00a0 85 H. 501 (App.), 946 P.2d 609 (1997).\n\u00a0 Section places a twenty-five per cent maximum total combined limit that can be taxed against a losing party by both the trial and appellate courts.\u00a0 87 H. 350 (App.), 956 P.2d 1282 (1998).\n\u00a0 Where counterclaim clearly sued for the amount of additional storage fees to be incurred for detained vehicle, twenty-five per cent of this amount was properly included in the amount prevailing counterclaim defendant was entitled to in attorneys' fees under this section.\u00a0 97 H. 47 (App.), 33 P.3d 543 (2001).\n\u00a0 Where attorney, as an individual, was not involved in the appeal and did not conduct \"his own case\", but was involved in the case as trustee and as the attorney for the trustee, the court could not award attorney fees to an attorney for representing a trustee when the same person was both the attorney and trustee as (1) there was the problem of double recovery (of trustee fees and attorney fees) and (2) there was the problem presented by rule 1.7 of the Hawaii rules of professional conduct--the general rule regarding conflict of interest.\u00a0 112 H. 231 (App.), 145 P.3d 774 (2006).\n\u00a0 Trial court did not err in awarding attorneys' fees based on the unjust enrichment award where plaintiffs' unjust enrichment claim was appropriately tried to the court (with the jury sitting in an advisory capacity), thereby essentially ruling that the action was an equity action within the realm of assumpsit.\u00a0 116 H. 42 (App.), 169 P.3d 994 (2007).\n\u00a0 Where the circuit court granted plaintiff's complaint for declaratory judgment, which effectively stopped defendants from continuing with their plans, plaintiff was the prevailing party and was properly awarded attorneys' fees and costs.\u00a0 123 H. 500 (App.), 236 P.3d 1236 (2010).\n\u00a0 A law firm that prevails in a court action to collect fees from a client may also be awarded attorney fees under this section for the work of an attorney employed with the law firm who represents the firm in the collection action.\u00a0 124 H. 187 (App.), 238 P.3d 714 (2010).\n\u00a0 Based on the facts and issues raised in plaintiff\u0092s complaint, the nature of the grievance, and the relief sought, where the essential character of the underlying action was one of equitable contribution under \u00a7483-2 and was not an action in the nature of assumpsit under this section, the circuit court abused its discretion in awarding attorney\u0092s fees and costs to defendants under this section.\u00a0 128 H. 366 (App.), 289 P.3d 1002 (2012).\n\u00a0 Cited:\u00a0 654 F.
