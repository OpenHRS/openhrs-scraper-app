XI, \u00a79 of the Hawaii\u00a0 constitution created a private right of action to enforce chapter 205, and the legislature confirmed the existence of that right of action by enacting this section, which allows for the recovery of attorneys' fees in such actions; chapter 205 is a law relating to environmental quality within the meaning of art. XI, \u00a79, section 9 is self-executing, and \u00a7205-12 imposes \"reasonable limitations and regulations\" that were applicable to the case which allowed the private right of action to enforce chapter 205.\u00a0 123 H. 391, 235 P.3d 1103 (2010)."
