Supp. 368 (1977).\n\u00a0 Where plea of not guilty and demand for jury trial by defendant charged with a misdemeanor conferred jurisdiction on circuit court, withdrawal of such plea and of demand for jury trial does not divest circuit court of jurisdiction.\u00a0 55 H. 394, 520 P.2d 427 (1974).\n\u00a0 Although misdemeanors are normally tried in district court, such offenses are within jurisdiction of circuit court.\u00a0 59 H. 92, 576 P.2d 1044 (1978).\n\u00a0 Court has jurisdiction over all civil causes of action unless precluded by state constitution or statute.\u00a0 63 H. 55, 621 P.2d 346 (1980).\n\u00a0 Regardless of whether a jury trial is demanded, circuit court may properly exercise jurisdiction over DUI cases; both the circuit and district courts have concurrent jurisdiction over DUI cases.\u00a0 78 H. 367, 893 P.2d 795 (1995).\n\u00a0 Circuit court had jurisdiction under this section to consider attorney general's request for declaratory judgment and related injunctions regarding proposed constitutional amendments where not precluded by Hawaii constitution or other statute.\u00a0 84 H. 179, 932 P.2d 316 (1997).\n\u00a0 Circuit court had subject matter jurisdiction over the case where county's first amended complaint asserted jurisdiction pursuant to this section, which provided the independent jurisdictional basis for the action brought pursuant to \u00a7603-23.\u00a0 115 H. 15, 165 P.3d 916 (2007).\n\u00a0 As the doctrine of abatement did not apply, the trial court did not lack subject matter jurisdiction over the second condemnation proceeding because the first condemnation proceeding had not been resolved at the time the second condemnation proceeding was adjudicated by the court.\u00a0 119 H. 352, 198 P.3d 615 (2008).\n\u00a0 Circuit court was statutorily authorized, in aid of its original jurisdiction over mortgage foreclosure actions, to enter appropriate orders against successful bidder at a judicial foreclosure sale after successful bidder defaulted on agreement to purchase the mortgaged property at the foreclosure sale.\u00a0 96 H. 348 (App.), 31 P.3d 205 (2001).\n\u00a0 Relevant statutes, rules, and precedent did not permit wife to directly attack in circuit court the validity of the property and distribution part of the divorce decree; circuit court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to do what wife must have had done to obtain the relief wife sought; pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7580-1 and 580-47, only the family court could have granted that relief.\u00a0 101 H. 370 (App.), 68 P.3d 644 (2003)."
