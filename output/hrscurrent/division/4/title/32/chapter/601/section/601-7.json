Mata:\u00a0 Disqualification of a Trial Judge.\u00a0 13 UH L. Rev. 641 (1991).\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 See also note to Organic Act \u00a784.\n\u00a0 Does not apply to justices of an appellate court.\u00a0 41 H. 270 (1956).\n\u00a0 Voluntary withdrawal from participation.\u00a0 41 H. 270 (1956).\u00a0 Voluntary withdrawal of justices from participation.\u00a0 53 H. 174, 488 P.2d 1406 (1971).\n\u00a0 Review by prohibition does not lie where claim of bias and prejudice is based on facts occurring on trial and ultimately appealable.\u00a0 45 H. 44, 361 P.2d 60 (1961).\n\u00a0 State in criminal case may seek prohibition upon refusal to disqualify.\u00a0 48 H. 247, 397 P.2d 575 (1964).\n\u00a0 Provision for judge recusing oneself, control by supreme court over application of this provision.\u00a0 49 H. 578, 586, 618, 426 P.2d 298 (1967).\n\u00a0 Provision requires strict construction to avoid abuses.\u00a0 55 H. 80, 515 P.2d 1250 (1973).\n\u00a0 \"Rule of necessity\" requires judge to participate in a decision notwithstanding judge's personal interest if the case cannot be heard otherwise.\u00a0 57 H. 348, 555 P.2d 1329 (1976).\n\u00a0 Judge presiding over initial probate trial and a subsequent jury trial on same fact issues does not violate this section.\u00a0 61 H. 236, 602 P.2d 521 (1979).\n\u00a0 Because judge ruled on the motion to disqualify judge, attorney's failure to file timely motion to disqualify would not be deemed a waiver of attorney's right to seek a disqualification; judge did not err when judge denied attorney's disqualification motion.\u00a0 76 H. 187, 873 P.2d 66 (1994).\n\u00a0 Where \"evidence\" of personal bias offered by defendant did not involve matters of personal interest to the judge but concerned primarily matters affecting the judge's exercise of judicial discretion, motion for disqualification properly denied; also, neither imposition of jail sentence upon defendant nor scheduling of post-appeal hearings demonstrated bias on part of judge.\u00a0 89 H. 371, 974 P.2d 11 (1998).\n\u00a0 Where alleged improper ex parte communication with judge by former officer of plaintiff regarding hotel was unrelated to case, former officer was not a party to the litigation or a witness, and judge did not know at time of conversation with former officer whether hotel was owned by plaintiff or defendant, no personal bias by judge under this section.\u00a0 92 H. 243, 990 P.2d 713 (1999).\n\u00a0 Where: \u00a0(1) record reflected no animosity by the judge against petitioner, and the motion to disqualify was based solely on a declaration by petitioner\u0092s attorney which did not set forth specific facts beyond speculation that there was the \u0093potential for partiality\u0094, there was no legal showing that the judge would have a personal bias in the case under this section; and (2) petitioner did not establish any disqualifying facts that would reasonably cast suspicion on the judge\u0092s impartiality, the appeals court did not abuse its discretion in holding that the facts as alleged were not sufficient to warrant the judge\u0092s recusal.\u00a0 128 H. 423, 290 P.3d 493 (2012).\n\u00a0 To disqualify judge, party was required to act before the judge entered ruling on the merits and in conformity with section.\u00a0 2 H. App. 1, 625 P.2d 378 (1981).\n\u00a0 Trial judge did not have to recuse herself from various show cause hearings because judge was privy to confidential information as a result of settlement negotiations; however, order dismissing plaintiff's complaint with prejudice vacated to remedy due process concerns raised by the handling of ex parte communications mailed from defendant to judge discussing the merits of the order to show cause hearings.\u00a0 97 H. 354 (App.), 37 P.3d 603 (2001).\n\u00a0 Affidavit filed by counsel did not satisfy the statutory requirement for the party seeking disqualification to attest to the disqualifying facts; even assuming plaintiff had complied with the statutory requirements, counsel's declaration failed to sufficiently state facts showing bias or prejudice on the part of the judge and was speculative at best.\u00a0 117 H. 477 (App.), 184 P.3d 792 (2008).\n\u00a0 Where it took an adverse decision and over two months after trial had concluded for attorney to file an affidavit alleging bias, trial judge\u0092s order to deny motion to disqualify affirmed.\u00a0 127 H. 346 (App.), 279 P.3d 11 (2012).\n\u00a0 Disqualification of judge.\u00a0 Statutory grounds, whether exclusive.\u00a0 17 H. 428 (1906).\u00a0 Disqualification to sit on reserved question.\u00a0 31 H. 150 (1929).\u00a0 Timeliness of suggestion of disqualification.\u00a0 41 H. 270 (1956); 44 H. 483, 357 P.2d 110 (1960); 49 H. 578, 426 P.2d 298 (1967).\u00a0 Disqualification for bias or prejudice in favor of \"opposite party\"; who is \"opposite party\".\u00a0 49 H. 578, 586, 616-617, 426 P.2d 298 (1967).\n\u00a0 Subs.
