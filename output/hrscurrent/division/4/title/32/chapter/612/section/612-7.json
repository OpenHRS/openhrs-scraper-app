[L 1973, c 191, pt of \u00a71; gen ch 1985; am L 2007, c 122, \u00a74]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Order excusing a juror from further duty is in the discretion of the court and cannot be reversed by mandamus.\u00a0 13 H. 332 (1901); 21 H. 66 (1912).\n\u00a0 Where prospective juror was prosecutor currently employed by same office as prosecutor trying the defendant, court shall imply bias as a matter of law and dismiss prospective juror for cause.\u00a0 86 H. 195, 948 P.2d 1036 (1997).\n\u00a0 Blood relationship between juror's and defendant's families was not \"slight or trivial cause\"; thus, it was within court's discretion to excuse juror for cause.\u00a0 93 H. 344 (App.), 3 P.3d 510 (2000)."
