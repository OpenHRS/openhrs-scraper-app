29 H. 122 (1926).\n\u00a0 Interpretation of lease.\u00a0 31 H. 720 (1930).\n\u00a0 Declaratory relief granted to test validity of criminal statute, when.\u00a0 47 H. 652, 394 P.2d 618 (1964).\n\u00a0 Existence of another adequate remedy does not preclude seeking a declaration.\u00a0 48 H. 68, 395 P.2d 691 (1964).\n\u00a0 Interpretation of real estate development contract.\u00a0 49 H. 214, 412 P.2d 925 (1966).\n\u00a0 Issue of decedent's domicile, declaratory judgment action to determine.\u00a0 50 H. 162, 434 P.2d 309 (1967).\n\u00a0 Action to determine validity of ordinances amending city's general plan.\u00a0 51 H. 400, 462 P.2d 199 (1969).\n\u00a0 Where there are conflicting interpretations on plaintiff's right to rent supplement under \u00a7359-121 et seq., there is actual controversy.\u00a0 53 H. 213, 491 P.2d 114 (1971).\n\u00a0 Where claims of parties are dismissed on a stipulation, parties no longer have any concrete interest in an actual controversy, and court may not render a declaratory judgment.\u00a0 56 H. 104, 529 P.2d 198 (1974).\n\u00a0 Proceedings for interpretation of constitutional provision not permitted where no immediate need.\u00a0 57 H. 213, 552 P.2d 1392 (1976).\n\u00a0 Actual controversy where plaintiffs have \"stake\" in outcome but are neither owners nor adjoining owners of lands subject to use reclassification.\u00a0 63 H. 166, 623 P.2d 431 (1981).\n\u00a0 Section precluded in issues arising under workers' compensation law.\u00a0 64 H. 380, 641 P.2d 1333 (1982).\n\u00a0 Action for declaratory judgment did not lie because review was subject to section 91-14.\u00a0 66 H. 485, 666 P.2d 1133 (1983).\n\u00a0 Circuit court had jurisdiction over plaintiff's petition under this section for declaratory relief.\u00a0 Court was not required to defer to agency's determination; court could make its own independent findings regarding the salient facts of the case.\u00a0 75 H. 237, 858 P.2d 726 (1993).\n\u00a0 Although plaintiffs were neither owners nor adjoining owners of development project, where they asserted that they were long time and frequent users of the coastline and that project may cause irreversible changes to the coastline, they nonetheless alleged an injury in fact sufficient to constitute standing to participate in a declaratory judgment action.\u00a0 91 H. 94, 979 P.2d 1120 (1999).\n\u00a0 Where there was no actual controversy because the fee owners were requesting a declaratory judgment based on the expiration of the master lease, an event that was to occur at some time in the future, there was no actual controversy in existence at the time; therefore, the relief that the fee owners had requested was properly denied under this section.\u00a0 104 H. 468, 92 P.3d 477 (2004).\n\u00a0 As it has long been established that declaratory relief is not appropriate for criminal matters \"where a full and adequate remedy is provided by another well-known form of action\", particularly by testing the statute in a criminal proceeding, case lacked the special circumstances that would warrant declarative action.\u00a0 109 H. 230, 124 P.3d 975 (2006).\n\u00a0 Where claim for quo warranto was not before the supreme court, it was premature for the supreme court to determine whether quo warranto was the only appropriate remedy to the exclusion of an action for declaratory judgment before that question was presented to the trial court on remand.\u00a0 122 H. 251, 226 P.3d 421 (2010).\n\u00a0 As nothing in chapter 103F expressly precluded judicial review, it did not violate the separation of powers doctrine; judicial review was available in connection with chapter 103F by way of a declaratory action under this section.\u00a0 127 H. 76, 276 P.3d 645 (2012).\n\u00a0 Petitioner's right to equal protection under article I, \u00a75 of the Hawaii constitution not violated as nothing in chapter 103F prohibited judicial review; judicial review was available by way of a declaratory action under this section.\u00a0 127 H. 76, 276 P.3d 645 (2012).\n\u00a0 As construed, chapter 103F was not unconstitutional for violating the doctrine of separation of powers as petitioner contended, because although the department of education, in interpreting and applying provisions of chapter 103F and in deciding disputes to which it is a party, exercises aspects of the judicial power, its decisions are subject to judicial review under this section.\u00a0 127 H. 263, 277 P.3d 988 (2012).\n\u00a0 Where there was an implied legislative intent to create a remedy for a purchasing agency\u0092s failure to comply with chapter 103F, and correlatively, nothing expressly indicating an intent to deny one, there was a private right of action allowed against the State (i.e., the department of education) under this section specifically challenging a decision made under chapter 103F, as to whether the relevant administrative officers complied with the statutes, rules, and the request for proposals.\u00a0 127 H. 263, 277 P.3d 988 (2012).\n\u00a0 Where it could not be determined from the allegations whether there was a substantial controversy as to a particular contract that was of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant a declaratory judgment, a declaratory judgment generally declaring that all contracts issued under \u00a73\u00ad-122-166 (repealed), Hawaii administrative rules, are invalidated could not be issued pursuant to this section.\u00a0 132 H. 333, 322 P.3d 228 (2014).\n\u00a0 No jurisdiction to entertain declaratory judgment to pass upon validity of release of mechanic's and materialman's lien.\u00a0 2 H. App. 132, 627 P.2d 291 (1981).\n\u00a0 Taxpayer's request for confirmation that under chapter 420 it was a valid business development corporation that was exempt from taxes based on income, was a \"controversy with respect to taxes\" for which declaratory relief was unavailable under this section.\u00a0 92 H. 659 (App.), 994 P.2d 591 (1999).\n\u00a0 This section did not authorize trial court to decide the declaratory judgment action when insurer of insured/alleged tortfeasor brought declaratory judgment action that insurer did not have a duty to defend or indemnify the insured/alleged tortfeasor regarding the motor vehicle accident and the declaratory judgment action was only against the alleged victim and not the insured/alleged tortfeasor.\u00a0 94 H. 498 (App.), 17 P.3d 847 (2001)."
