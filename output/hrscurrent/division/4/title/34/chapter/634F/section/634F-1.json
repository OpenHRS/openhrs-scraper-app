[L 2002, c 187, pt of \u00a72]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Given the allegations in plaintiff's complaint, the filing of the office of disciplinary counsel (ODC) complaint by defendant against plaintiff did not constitute \"public participation\" before a governmental body, as defined in this section, because the ODC complaint did not involve \"oral or written testimony\" but rather set forth allegations and was a request to the ODC for an investigation.\u00a0 Based on the plain meaning of \"testimony\", even when liberally construed, the ODC complaint and allegations contained therein were not \"testimony\" and were not protected under chapter 634F.\u00a0 129 H. 95 (App.), 294 P.3d 1081 (2013).\n\u00a0 With respect to plaintiff's claims based on defendant siblings' communications with the mayor, the mayor's assistant, and members of the county council, the communications did not constitute \"testimony\" submitted or provided \"during the course of a governmental proceeding\" and did not constitute a strategic lawsuit against public participation.\u00a0 Even under a liberal construction of this section, nothing in chapter 634F suggests that an individual's unsolicited and informal communication with a government official, when there is no formal process or procedure in progress, constitutes \"testimony submitted or provided to a governmental body during the course of a governmental proceeding\".\u00a0 129 H. 95 (App.), 294 P.3d 1081 (2013)."
