Levinson:\u00a0 Limitations on a Criminal Defendant's Use of Peremptory Challenges.\u00a0 13 UH L. Rev. 279 (1991).\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Where four joint defendants joined in each of ten challenges, held that they had exercised their full right of challenge, although each would have been allowed ten challenges if taken separately.\u00a0 3 H. 90 (1869).\n\u00a0 Defendant allowed twelve peremptory challenges only when the charged offense itself carries penalty of life imprisonment.\u00a0 65 H. 354, 652 P.2d 1119 (1982).\n\u00a0 Circuit court plainly erred where, during jury selection, it removed two jurors for cause on the motion of respondent after the jury panel already had been passed for cause, and defendant and respondent had already exhausted their peremptory challenges; this procedure violated rule 24 of the HRPP, which provides that challenges for cause may be made at any time prior to the exercise of peremptory challenges, and in effect abrogated the parity in the number of peremptories each side is guaranteed pursuant to this section.\u00a0 127 H. 415, 279 P.3d 683 (2012)."
