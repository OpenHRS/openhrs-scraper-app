App. 31, 859 P.2d 1380 (1993).\n\u00a0 Trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying motion for new trial; record provided substantial evidence to support jury verdict.\u00a0 10 H. App. 298, 869 P.2d 1352 (1994).\n\u00a0 Trial court abused its discretion in granting plaintiff's motion for new trial where it put great weight on its own factual finding regarding defendant, thereby usurping the rightful role and constitutional prerogative of the jury in weighing contradictory evidence and inferences, judging the credibility of witnesses, receiving expert instructions, and drawing the ultimate conclusion as to the facts.\u00a0 99 H. 287 (App.), 54 P.3d 923 (2002).\n\u00a0 Erroneous admission or rejection of evidence.\u00a0 8 H. 247 (1891);
