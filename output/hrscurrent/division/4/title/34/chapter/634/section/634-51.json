Supp. 695 (1976).\n\u00a0 Action in which plaintiff made fraudulent transfer claims under the Hawaii Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (chapter 651C), seeking to avoid the transfer of real property to the extent necessary to satisfy plaintiff's claims and/or to grant plaintiff other relief under \u00a7651C-7(a), was an appropriate subject of a lis pendens under the Hawaii doctrine of lis pendens, codified in this section.\u00a0 457 F. Supp. 2d 1121 (2006).\n\u00a0\u00a0 Where plaintiffs filed a notice of pendency of action pursuant to this section and \u00a7501-151, magistrate judge's order, in applying Sports Shinko to the facts of the case to deny defendant's motion to expunge, was not clearly erroneous or contrary to law.\u00a0 529 F. Supp. 2d 1206 (2007).\n\u00a0 Party may not invoke lis pendens where party's interest in land is only a percentage of the income derived from the use of land and there is no right to title or control of the land.\u00a0 72 H. 267, 814 P.2d 396 (1991).\n\u00a0 Alleged equitable lien and filing of lis pendens not breach of covenant against encumbrances since lien was not actually in existence, valid, and enforceable at time of conveyance; a recorded lis pendens is an encumbrance.\u00a0 75 H. 480, 866 P.2d 951 (1994).\n\u00a0 Where complainant does not claim title to or a right of possession of property, section not implicated and lis pendens should have been expunged.\u00a0 75 H. 480, 866 P.2d 951 (1994).\n\u00a0 Where trial court's judgment in favor of defendant extinguished any claims plaintiff had against defendant and filing of appeal did not affect validity of the judgment being appealed from, lis pendens properly expunged as it was no longer based on \"any action concerning real property\".\u00a0 92 H. 243, 990 P.2d 713 (1999).\n\u00a0 Where mortgagors' rights to property extinguished through foreclosure, that issue is res judicata.\u00a0 4 H. App. 439, 667 P.2d 834 (1983).\n\u00a0 Where appellants filed both of their motions for notice of pendency of action after the decree of foreclosure, after the order confirming the foreclosure sale was entered, and after the writ of possession had been issued by the court in favor of the bank, the sale of the property to a third party rendered the appeal of the expungement of the lis pendens moot.\u00a0 117 H. 506 (App.), 184 P.3d 821 (2008).\n\u00a0 Where developer did not seek to directly obtain title to, or possession of, property, but rather sought to avoid the transfer of the property owner\u0092s and lessee\u0092s interest in the property for the purpose of securing payment of money which might potentially be owed if developer succeeded on its counterclaims, the developer\u0092s claim under chapter 651C, the Hawaii Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, was asserted for a purpose which was rejected as a basis for a lis pendens under this section; thus, circuit court did not abuse its discretion in granting county\u0092s motion to expunge developer\u0092s lis pendens.\u00a0 128 H. 378 (App.), 289 P.3d 1014 (2012)."
