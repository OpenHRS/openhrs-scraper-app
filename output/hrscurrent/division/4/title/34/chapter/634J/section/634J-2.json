[L 1993, c 124, pt of \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 As matters under this section are not exceptional matters, while a family court case (including an independent action) is on appeal, the family court has no jurisdiction to act in the case on appeal pursuant to this chapter absent prior permission by the appellate court having jurisdiction over the appeal.\u00a0 97 H. 340 (App.), 37 P.3d 589 (2001)."
