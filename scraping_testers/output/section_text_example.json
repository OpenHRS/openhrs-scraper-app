[L 1965, c 208, \u00a72-725; HRS \u00a7490:2-725]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 For cases involving artwork, a warranty of authenticity given by the merchant constitutes an express warranty of future performance sufficient to toll the statute of limitations.\u00a0 745 F. Supp. 1556.\n\u00a0 Applies to an implied warranty of merchantability.\u00a0 747 F. Supp. 1396.\n\u00a0 Limitations period for plaintiff's warranty claims elapsed, at the very latest, four years after last alleged date of decedent's exposure to defendant's asbestos-containing products.\u00a0 854 F. Supp. 702.\n\u00a0 No equal protection violation, where plaintiff argued that \u00a7490:2-725 discriminated among two classes of warranty claimants, and appeared to argue that UCC arbitrarily discriminated among differing classes of defendants, insofar as it granted partial immunity to those in commercial sales without similarly limiting the liability of others potentially liable for industrial diseases.\u00a0 854 F. Supp. 702.\n\u00a0 Plaintiff's breach of warranty claims were barred by operation of four year statute of limitations applicable to such claims, which period ran at the latest, four years from date plaintiff had ruptured breast implants removed from plaintiff's body.\u00a0 945 F. Supp. 1334.\n\u00a0 Section's limitations period applies to implied warranty claim for personal injury from pacemaker, rather than two-year limitations period for personal injury actions under \u00a7657-7.\u00a0 74 H. 1, 837 P.2d 1273.\n\u00a0 UCC statute of limitations applies to breach of express warranty claim for personal injury.\u00a0 86 H. 383 (App.), 949 P.2d 1004.\n\u00a0 By express limitation, \u00a7657-18 does not apply to toll the statute of limitations period set forth in this section.\u00a0 93 H. 174 (App.), 998 P.2d 55.\n\u00a0\n"
